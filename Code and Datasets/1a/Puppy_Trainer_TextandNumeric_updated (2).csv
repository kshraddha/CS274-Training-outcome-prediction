I also go jogging most mornings, and when the pup is older and strong enough I know s/he would love to keep me company for a few miles around the neighborhood each morning.   I have always had a pet dog, and have always raised them from a puppy. Now, my last dog is in heaven and my home has no pets.

My work week is Monday thru Friday, however I work for myself and make my own hours. The work environment is very calm in that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist and Yoga Therapist. The office is about 15 min from my house and is located on the second floor of a very old factory building, think Erector Sets the toy from years and years ago! It has wooden floors and big windows that are up higher, a very forgiving environment with lots of stairs and hallways. I can easily have a kennel there and my clients are looking forward to meeting our new friend. I plan to have enough time inbetween appointments to give the pup my complete attention, which is just a matter of how I choose to book the appointments. I can also have the pup at home and break up the day from morning and afternoon by being home for several hours. Most probably a bit of both. Two Wednesdays a month I am away from home from 8:45 until 5:00 (including travel time) working in a corporate setting. On these 2 days my daughter (Alison 31) has agreed to spend time with our little girl or guy. Joan Moore, also a puppy raiser, has also agreed to me dropping the pup off at her house for some pup playtime. I don't work on weekends. The home life looks like this: 2 female sister cats who are 2.5 years old and do not go outside. They have never scratched or bitten me or anyone else, and are very timid although curious and friendly. They are up to date on their shots and I use Revolution on them even though they are inside, just to be safe. My partner is John Terry who is an absolute lover of all animals and most importantly very well trained by me! (Hehehe) Meaning, he understands that I am the main trainer for the pup and he is willing to be on the same page with me in all the activities concerning the pup. We live in a small cape home (1,200 sq feet) which is already animal safe because of our cats. We do not have sidewalks, and the road we live on is relatively busy, however, there are side roads which are not. I am also willing to drive to where there are sidewalks to get a diversified experience. I believe that we are relatively well setup for this experience. I can only say relatively because it hasn't happened yet! But wherever we may be lacking we are willing to do what we need to do to improve the accommodations. I am a bit nervous! It's a tremendous responsibility, however, I also know that I communicate better with all animals than people, so I feel confident to learn the language. I have had 2 dogs before in my life, they were my best friends and will always be a part of who I am. In retrospect, I am surprised they were as well behaved as they were considering I knew nothing! An additional thought I would like to add is my request for a black dog. I live in black leggings for my work and the maintenance of the removal of yellow hair would be something that I really would rather not have to devote time to. I do hope that doesn't sound offensive in any way, but if I know me, this pup is going to very close to me most of the time and I plan on being hairy. I also believe, but perhaps not accurately, that the female black labs tend to be a little smaller, which given the ways in which I depend on the well being of my fingers, hands and arms, might make more sense for me. All THAT being said, I soooo do not wish to create criteria that puts me right out of the program, so it's just my humble opinion. Oh, and I bend, crawl, jump, bark and roll over. Wait, I won't bark.  I hope I have created a picture that is clear, and user friendly for all of us. Thank you for this wonderful opportunity, I have already learned so very much and it's hardly begun. Peace"

No children. Our home sits in the middle of three acres outside of a housing track but on a somewhat busy road.  Plenty of side walks along the road and into the neighbor hoods/housing tracks, around us that work into an elementary school.  Most times the area is very quiet but the occasion loud picnic occurs.  Being in Henrietta has it good and bad.  Bad, it's a grid town and not a village to walk to different places.  Good, there are still plenty of businesses, plazas & mall, Town Hall, library, and grocery stores to sit and watch activities and still short distance drives.    We have raised 8 puppies for Guiding Eyes, last two being Halsa (7HH10) and her mom Shelby.  Puppy number 5, Verna, was a medical release who we adopted and is still with us today at the age  of 12.     We both work Monday - Friday.  Donna works 8:30am - 4:30pm; Steve varies from 4:30am - 2:00pm.  Donna works in an office at the University of Rochester where Halsa spent many days a week like her mom Shelby.  Steve is a route driver for a coffee company so no opportunity to have the puppy with him at work.  Our weekends are generally open to doing things around the house to family/friend events that may come up.  Sunday morning is church which will be an opportunity to socialize.    Both of us enjoy running races, 5K's, 10k's, 1/2 and full marathons during the year, more Steve than Donna.  Depending on locations and size of race, these have been good outings based on the puppy's age.  Lots to see but plenty of space to back away when needed.      We are looking forward to raising another puppy and hopefully one of Halsa's puppies to say we raised a mom, daughter and grand daughter.    Cheers -  Donna & Steve Derks"

Our daughter Alli is soon to be 16 and is going to be an integral part of the puppy raising. Zach, our oldest leaves for college in the fall and is looking forward to helping when he is home. I work for Verizon and often pass through town and can stop for a quick check and bathroom time. There is always someone home from 3:30 in the afternoon till morning. Our weekends are extremely flexible with occasional trips to parade and fire dept functions. This will be an excellent opportunity for socialization when the puppy is ready. Kathy is a teacher and class adviser which will allow the pup to attend many different social environments through school. Wes is a county fire coordinator and would be able to take the pup to meetings and expose the pup to another experience. Our extended family also has many animals to expose the pup to. (cows,goats,rabbits,cat,chickens,horses) We have had three previous dogs as pets. A golden retriever,beagle and a dalmatian. The dalmatian was trained and proficient enough to march in the parades with Wes off leash and was a real crowd favorite. We have had a relationship with our Vet for over twenty years and find them very caring and willing to make emergency calls if necessary.

We currently do not have any other pets.  During the week, we live in a small townhouse, but on the weekends we live in a slightly larger log home on 15 acres.  Neither home has a fence so we are used to constantly having the dogs we have owned in the past on leash.      The townhouse is three levels and the floor surfaces are vinyl tile, concrete, and carpet.  We have stairs that go down into the basement and up to the second floor.  Our townhouse backs up to a small shopping area that has a grocery store, two eating establishments, and other small retail establishments.  There is always some type of activity going on in the neighborhood either the yard crews are cutting the grass (noisy lawnmowers, leaf blowers), kids are playing in front of our house, the mailman is delivering the mail, etc.  We also live about 5 blocks from an elementary school and community pool - all of this is in our subdivision.  There are sidewalks and bike paths to walk the puppy along. We walk to the grocery store 2-3 times a week to go grocery shopping.  We have a fire department 3 blocks from our house that has fire trucks and an ambulance. We also live close to Frederick City and can go into the city in the evenings for social outings.  The city has a lot more cars and distractions then at either of our other two houses.      Out at the cabin, the puppy will get to experience, rocky roads, dirt paths, grassy paths, various wildlife (turkey, deer, bear, snakes, bobcat, grouse etc.), mud, and lots of water.  The log house is 2 hours from our townhouse so the puppy will get used to ""riding"" with us.  The floor surfaces inside the home are ceramic tile, carpet, and hardwood flooring.  We have sliding glass doors and the inevitable screen doors that all of our dogs have had to learn about.    I have family that live on the Eastern shore so the puppy will be exposed to the bay and ocean, Annapolis, sea gulls, sand, etc.      During the week, my husband works from home 5 days a week and I work at home 2 days a week.  My husband travels about 2-3 times a year for about a week at a time.  I travel anywhere from 0-6 times a year from 1-2 weeks each time.  The puppy will not be going on work travel since we will be in areas that do not allow animals.  My husband and I coordinate travel so one person will be home while the other person is traveling.  Once the puppy is housebroken and has a little more self-control he will be going to my office with me.  My office is an hour away from my house and I leave at 5 AM.  Work consists of sitting around reading at my desk, going to meetings, going to the Farmer's Market on Tuesdays, riding in elevators, walking up stairs, going through sliding glass doors, going to the cafeteria for lunch, going through security check points, walking on carpet, tile, marble, and concrete.  I work on a Federal Government Campus so we are fairly isolated and there is a lot of open space and trees where I work.  Inside the buildings, there is a lot of glass and open spaces.  My job may be changing soon which will mean less work traveling and more time actually going into the office instead of working from home.  It will just mean that the puppy makes the trek into my office more times per week then he would be doing now.      Any personal travel that my husband and I have done in the past we have always brought our dogs so vacation time is making sure the dogs can go along too.  The puppy will be used to hotels and long rides.    That's about it.  Our life is pretty ordinary, but we do have a lot of different things going on."

They are very understanding and interested in my commitment to raising a GEB puppy and have already altered my schedule so I can attend puppy classes on Monday evenings.  I am very much a homebody and enjoy gardening, bike riding and walking, hiking in the summer and reading, cooking and baking in the winter, hence the 20lb gain from our past fabulous WNY winter.   My 20 year old daughter is home from school for the summer and works at our complex as a lifeguard.  She is attending a local college and is studying Animal Behavior and Ecology Conservation.  She is very excited about this opportunity to raise a puppy for a visually impaired person, a child or some other alternative career.  We have never had a puppy or dog as this is something I did not want to even attempt without having the proper training to be a successful and responsible dog guardian.  I thought this would be a fabulous experience for both of us and give us a taste of being responsible puppy/dog lovers and owners for the benefit of someone in need.  We are animal lovers but have always been cat people and let's be honest, it doesn't take much to be a good cat caretaker.  We currently have two house cats that do not go outside.  They are both spayed females.  Pixie is a year and a half and Belle is going to turn 4 on July 7th.  They have a love hate relationship and both sleep on purr pads on my bed (this is the love part) or in their cat tree.  They also love to watch the birds in our feeder from the sliding glass door in the living room.  We live in a two-story townhouse in a beautiful parklike setting.  We have lots of green space and plenty of opportunities for socialization.  We also live very close to a village for walking experiences.  My daughter and I walk on a regular basis and are both in perfect health.  We are hoping for a sweet female to complete our girl pad!  We can't wait to meet our new family member and are hopeful it will be soon after our ""graduation"" as I am off from my full time job for the summer!

We also have a cat who has been around our dogs since she came to us as a kitten and even with claws, she NEVER swats the dogs.    Our daily routine:  Dave wakes between 5 and 6 a.m.  lets the dogs out, feeds them, lets them out again.  I usually wake at 5:45 am, go to the pool and swim, come home, dress and leave for work.  Dave will then take the 3 dogs and walk 4 miles. (We started walking 3 dogs when we had Belmont).  He is home with them most of the day except when he does errands; he grooms the shepherds a couple times a week and I groom the Yorkie once a month (bath and clipping).  He does a second walk later in the day depending on the temperature outside.  I come home from work and we are on the porch or relaxing inside and then eat dinner.  Before bed, the dogs go out again.  When we get the pup, I will adjust my routine to include a morning walk and an evening walk as well as ""play"" since Dave will not be able to walk 4 dogs.  I will also ensure the progressive socialization of the pup (had to do this with Tex); started with short walks in the cul de sac, then the next neighborhood, then the little shopping plaza up the street, etc.      Dave works for NVCC; he is an Associate Dean and Teacher; most of his work is virtual.  When regular semesters are in session, he goes into the campus for about 4 hours 2 - 3 times a week.  I live about 8 min. from my job and have flexibility with telework.  When we raised Belmont she went to work with me on the Metro a couple times a week (downtown D.C.).    I swim because of my lumbar discs; can't run anymore.  On the weekends I take the shepherds and play ball (which they love) to let them stretch their legs.  On Saturdays we often take the younger shepherd, Tex,  and the Yorkie (Huey) to Reston Town Center where James Oliver (DogU) has group socialization for many of his clients and their dogs.  We have been taking Tex out since he was a pup (almost 2 years now).    This has been a fabulous experience for the noise, kids, and crowd socialization.     We have 2 local grandkids (10 and 8) who have dogs and have been around our Belmont for the past 5 years.  They will spend the night a couple times a quarter.    Our schedules are very flexible and we both plan to take the Pup to work on various days after the little one earns his/her vest.    Weekends I take advantage of the time off to take the shepherds on a long walk on the bike path; they are champs and can handle the bikers, runners, and other dogs as well as strollers.    My personal work travel is minimal and very manageable; Dave does not travel.  Our personal travel; we will be going to Europe in Oct. for bike trip:)    I currently am an Adoption Coordinator for Lab Rescue and have been reducing my applicant pool so I am ""freed"" up when we get a pup.  My time will be dedicated to the pup.   It has been just 2 years since Tex joined our pack at age 3 months, so we are puppy refreshed:)    I hope this helps!  WOOF, Mary  "

We are confident that together, we have the ability to to care for the dog and accommodate its schedule and needs as a young puppy.  We have 2 cats, aged 5 years and 14 years.  We are recent , previous dog owners and the cats had been accustomed to, and loved having a dog as a house companion!    We enjoy being outdoors and and going to different places and would be excited about bringing the puppy along!  We are a relaxed and casual family, and would desire a puppy that matches our gentle and affectionate demeanor.  We are early risers and look forward to the weekends when we can just hang out, or go out and explore!  We have no physical restrictions that would impact our ability to raise a puppy.  We have learned a bit about the puppy raising experience from an acquaintance who has raised 6 Guiding Eyes puppies.  We have been to Patterson and Yorktown and are really excited about the mission of the Guiding Eyes program!  We look forward to cuddling, nurturing and teaching a pup to become someone's trusted companion and guide!"

There are three humans and 2 dogs in our home.  I, Michelle, work from 8:30-5:00 Monday through Friday (from home). Although my job is busy, I have the ability to intermittently address concerns around the home (i.e. letting the dogs in and out, feeding the dogs, doing some laundry).  Prior to work I try to ""set up"" for the day by preparing dinner, doing laundry, cleaning up the house, and working out.    Joe, my husband is home all day long as well. Because of an illness he has, he tends not to leave the house for extended periods of time. He is generally home for most of the day and is able to tend to the pets and drop off/pick up our daughter from school. He performs ""light duty"" around the home.  Our daughter Katie is 11 years old and in the sixth grade. Her school is very close to our home (within 2 miles). When she is not in school she spends much of her time playing with our 2 Jack Russell Terriers and doing gymnastics.  We live on a quiet cul-de-sac with sidewalks and we have neighbors who pop in from time to time to visit.    Our dogs, Ginger and Daphne are 5 years old. They are sisters and are very loveable and playful.  They love being outdoors and playing in our large fenced yard.  They often get exercised with us as well as we bring them walking or running in the neighborhood or in the field behind our neighbor's house.  Additionally, we have a camp in Speculator, NY where we go frequently in the summer. Many of the people on the private campground where we stay are friends of ours.  Weekends are very low key. We generally stay around the house and run a few errands here and there. We routinely attend church on Sundays which is right next door.  We feel that we will be successful with puppy raising because we love dogs and we have a lifestyle that is conducive to providing a puppy with lots of opportunities to interact and learn throughout each and every day.

Then I usually have class in the afternoon classes and afternoon meeting can run back to back or have breaks in between where I head back to my room for periods of 30 minutes to an hour. or I go to the gym or for a quick walk before my next class/ meeting.      I usually eat my dinner between 4:30-7:00 its a large window but my evening changes depending on which classes I have. sometimes I skip the campus meal and order delivery to my room.   I stay up until 11:30 most nights doing homework, hosting floor or campus programs, peer counseling, or just hanging out with friends on rare occasions I go to the weight room at night (sometimes it is less crowded then), But mostly to exercise I go for walks up the road that goes though campus and walk up past farm lands during the evening hours because its when I have the most free time so I can walk until I get tired.     About 11 nights each semester I am on Duty for Residence Life. This means myself and one other RA walk around the campus residence halls twice a night at 7:00 and 10:00 on weekdays and three times a night 7:00, 10:00 and 1:00 on weekends to make sure all the residence are safe and following the rules and regulations of the campus. During these nights I would not bring the dog with me because some situations would be hard to handle while training a dog. The dog would either stay in its crate while I go on these rounds (each set takes approximately 30 min if there are no problems) or I would have the dog stay with the co-raiser or sitters.     Most weekends I am on campus because I try to maintain a presence as Resident Advisor for my floor, but we are advised through the reslife position to take a few weekends off throughout the year to give ourselves a break from our 24/7 job.     Which leads me to this, I can make a perfect schedule but I know that it wont be followed to a T because my residents will have crisis's that they need me for this can be minor crises (breakups, cuts, roommate disagreements) or they can be major crises (suicides, physical attacks, drugs/alcohol, seizures and other medical emergency's) I am usually their first call, this being said I have training to handle all of this and be able to prioritize and make sure everyone including the puppy is safe, and cared for. In minor situations the puppy would most likely stay with me, in major crisis I would most likely contact my GEB team to assist with the puppy or contact my RA staff to assist with the residents.     Overall my day as a college student is scattered due to class periods and schedule meal times but those scattered periods become a standardized schedule every year that I modify my lifestyle to fit. At the beginning of next year my GEB Co raisers and sitters are planning on sharing our schedules so we can cooperate when we each will have the puppy and make sure that someone is always available to care for it.  Below I have written my class schedule for next semester but it might change during the first few weeks of school and My work schedule has not been determined yet.

I stay up until 11:30 most nights doing homework, hosting floor or campus programs, peer counseling, or just hanging out with friends on rare occasions I go to the weight room at night (sometimes it is less crowded then), But mostly to exercise I go for walks up the road that goes though campus and walk up past farm lands during the evening hours because its when I have the most free time so I can walk until I get tired.     About 11 nights each semester I am on Duty for Residence Life. This means myself and one other RA walk around the campus residence halls twice a night at 7:00 and 10:00 on weekdays and three times a night 7:00, 10:00 and 1:00 on weekends to make sure all the residence are safe and following the rules and regulations of the campus. During these nights I would not bring the dog with me because some situations would be hard to handle while training a dog. The dog would either stay in its crate while I go on these rounds (each set takes approximately 30 min if there are no problems) or I would have the dog stay with the co-raiser or sitters.     Most weekends I am on campus because I try to maintain a presence as Resident Advisor for my floor, but we are advised through the reslife position to take a few weekends off throughout the year to give ourselves a break from our 24/7 job.     Which leads me to this, I can make a perfect schedule but I know that it wont be followed to a T because my residents will have crisis's that they need me for this can be minor crises (breakups, cuts, roommate disagreements) or they can be major crises (suicides, physical attacks, drugs/alcohol, seizures and other medical emergency's) I am usually their first call, this being said I have training to handle all of this and be able to prioritize and make sure everyone including the puppy is safe, and cared for. In minor situations the puppy would most likely stay with me, in major crisis I would most likely contact my GEB team to assist with the puppy or contact my RA staff to assist with the residents.     Overall my day as a college student is scattered due to class periods and schedule meal times but those scattered periods become a standardized schedule every year that I modify my lifestyle to fit. At the beginning of next year my GEB Co raisers and sitters are planning on sharing our schedules so we can cooperate when we each will have the puppy and make sure that someone is always available to care for it.  Below I have written my class schedule for next semester but it might change during the first few weeks of school and My work schedule has not been determined yet.

We currently have an 11 year old  yorkie named Pierre and a cat. Our yard is fenced in. I am an avid walker and walk Pierre 4x a week.  I always have my dog on leash.  We visit family in the south towns. My family lives in the Bemus Point area and we do travel down there. We also have great neighbors.      We travel to see our son but mostly for long weekends and will be thrilled to have our daughter back on US soil. I enjoy cooking and Jim does the grilling. We are usually home every night. I attend a monthly book club and Bunco group in the neighborhood. We have season tickets to Shea's for a night out. Jim is an avid hiker and rides bikes for numerous charities.  We are both active with no health issues.     We prefer a male puppy and don't have a preference though my brother and Jim's sister have Labs.  I did grow up with German Shepards. We feel that Pierre is easy to get along with and when we visit my brother all the dogs do play together. I do have a large crate that we use for our boxer which is in the basement at this time. I'm looking forward to raising a puppy and i do have to say, I know it will be a lot of work but fun.     On question #18 I did not know if you wanted my vet or the vet that the Erie GEB uses.

This is not something I would consider until the puppy was more aware of and connected to me, but I know it would be a great experience for the children and the puppy. Who knows...the pup may become a stage star. The Heeling Autism Dogs have been part of our class plays for the last 4 years!    So if the puppy is at home while I am at work, there are 2 options My husband is retired and is willing to be there for the puppy during the day. I am home by 4:00 and leave the house at 8:00. My neighbor, Liz Parrone, is taking the puppy raising class with me and is willing to be available as the puppy sitter when needed.    During the school year I live in a house so the puppy will have easy access to the outdoors. We have a great neighborhood with lots of kids on bikes, lawn mower mowing, babies in strollers, etc. I have easy access to sidewalks along quiet and busy streets, There is also access to towns with community activity. We also have a 6.5 year old chocolate lab who pales both intellectually and socially in comparison to GEB dogs. However she is very gentle, loving, playful and good-looking! There is space in the house to separate the dogs when it becomes too distracting or overwhelming for the puppy.     In June I will be retiring! At that point I will be full time with the puppy. We have a home on the eastern end of Long Island. The puppy will spend the majority of the summer out there, We have a fenced in backyard for the puppy as well as all the other benefits listed above from Westchester. I will be home every week for the puppy class. (we have the check on the mother-in-law too!)

Afterwards, I usually spend 1-2 hours on the phone throughout the day and anywhere from 2-6 hours doing computer work - again, very flexible. In the evenings I enjoy cooking dinner, going to the gym, spending time with family, watching tv, playing with our family dog, visiting my nephews or cousins, and relaxing.    On the weekends I go to Zumba, church, and may run errands for the week including the grocery store, dry cleaning, etc. I will spend time with my sisters and friends, may travel to a nearby town or city for a day of exploring or bike riding, camp out in a library or unique bookstore to explore, enjoy a barbecue and bonfire with family, go to a concert, or spend the day playing with our pup.

I have lived in Massachusetts my whole life with my mom, Deb Kovacs, my dad, Chris Kovacs, and my younger sister, Amelia Kovacs. I am very excited to be starting this amazing process with Guiding Eyes for the Blind. I am a sophomore at Groton Dunstable Regional High School. Currently, I am competing in outdoor track and field for the high school. Track is my only sport; I have elected not to play fall soccer if I am accepted to be a puppy raiser.     This summer, I will not be working in order to devote as much of my free time as I can to the puppy. I will be free after school in the fall and winter as well. I am hoping to take on the role of the primary raiser for the puppy. I feel that I am responsible enough to care for a dog with the help of my family. I know that this is a great opportunity to help somebody else, and I want to be a large part of that.    My typical weekday during the track season (now through the end of May) is busy but manageable. I wake up around 5:00 a.m. every morning and get dressed, pack my bag, make my lunch, and get all ready for school. The bus picks me up around 6:40 and I arrive at school around 7:00. I finish school at 1:50 and go straight to track practice from 2:30-4:30. I arrive home around 4:45 and go to bed around 11:00. I realize that this schedule will mean I am away from home for most of the day, but it will last only about the next 9-10 weeks. My family is more than happy to help for the month when track and field and the puppy raising will coincide. My mom works part time and is planning to take a couple days off from work in order to spend more time with the puppy. My dad works from home and is happy to let the puppy outside frequently during the day so that it can eliminate.     I realize that for the first twelve weeks, the puppy classes will be held every Saturday. I know that the puppy takes precedence over almost everything, however, because the process is starting a little earlier than I expected, I have three dates that I may not be able to make the entire class. These three track meets are mandatory. The District Relays track meet is on May 2nd and it starts at 1 oÛªclock. The Division track meet is on May 30th at 1 oÛªclock. If I perform very well at the Division meet, I will qualify for the All State track meet on June 6th. Besides these track meets and SATÛªs the following spring, I have cleared every Saturday for the next year and a half. My Mom will be able to attend all of these classes.    I end school in mid June and start up again in late August. The summer is my most flexible time of the year; I have enough time to spend many hours a day with the puppy. I will also be receiving my driverÛªs license in July, which will allow me to do the majority of the transportation for the puppy.      In the fall, my weekdays will consist of school. I will be able to come home and care for the puppy around 2:00 every afternoon. In the winter, I will have a very similar schedule to the fall. My family normally has very free weekends. On Saturday nights we sometimes enjoy going to the mall, out to dinner, the movies, etc. During the summer and fall, we love to spend time outside and in Cape Cod. We have one dog already, a ten-year-old black lab. He is well trained and very loyal. We have a cat that is tolerant of him as well as twenty chickens.     In general, I like to take on new experiences. I attended Outward Bound 2 years in a row, which involved intense hiking and paddling, rock climbing, and a mentally challenging 2 day solo experience. I traveled on my own to and from California, finding my way through the airport to the meeting place.

I absolutely love animals, and am definitely a ÛÏdog person.Û The training program of GEB is appealing, and I am ready to learn and apply my new skills with a pup. I already love spending time with my pooch, walking him and playing with him daily. I am determined to make this project work for the new pup, whose success depends on me being consistent and available for its care and training. By teaming up with my mom and coordinating our schedules, I know we can make this a successful experience for a new pup.   "

I absolutely love animals, and am definitely a ÛÏdog person.Û The training program of GEB is appealing, and I am ready to learn and apply my new skills with a pup. I already love spending time with my pooch, walking him and playing with him daily. I am determined to make this project work for the new pup, whose success depends on me being consistent and available for its care and training. By teaming up with my mom and coordinating our schedules, I know we can make this a successful experience for a new pup.   "

Watch the news and weather then make my husbands lunch.  He leaves around 6:45 them I do any household chores doing.    My days change from day to depending on weather and what I will be doing.  I am a volunteer Onbudsman for Hands on the Hudson.  My job is to go into adult homes in Sullivan County and ensure the well being of the residents.  I report monthly to Hands on the Hudson who in turn report to Dept. Of Health.  This is a very, very flexible position I go when I choose as I have 24/7 access to the facilities.  So being home all the time is not a problem.  I will do it evenings when my husband is home or weekends.  We live outside of Monticello in the Town of Thompson in a rural community.  (8 houses down the street, if you can call that a community).  We lead a quiet life especially in the winter.  Summer we find places to go to walk, hike usually upstate.   My husband and I have had dogs all of our 32 years together.  From pure bred Huskie to lab/mixes.  Always big dogs 90lbs/plus.  Our most recent 2 dogs died in 2012.  They were our hearts and we were devastated when they died.  Swore we would never have anymore. When  we saw the Sullivan County Democrat article and write up about Guiding Eyes.  We discussed it and I went to your orientation meeting.  Decide that I wanted to be a part of this.  A few friends I have spoken to regard this have all asked the same question ""Will you be able to give the dog back"".  My answer is ""Yes, I am a temporary ""mom"" .Even though I know my heart will hurt the day he/or she leaves  I know that I will feel honored to have been a part of raising a puppy that will go on to do amazing things for a visually impaired person or an autistic child."

My home is located in a rural and quiet area of Livingston Manor, three miles from town, on a dead end street.  We have one pair of neighbors who live nearby year round, but there home is out of view.  We have three other sets of neighbors who visit their homes several times throughout the year.  My day begins around 5 am when my wife, Kathleen, wakes to get ready for work.  I wake up then too to prepare her breakfast and gourmet lunch!  She's a very lucky woman!  We read the paper - well I do Sudoku and she reads the paper.  We have breakfast together and my wife leaves for work around 7 am. After a 2nd cup of coffee, during the winter months, I head outside to feed the visiting birds.  In the warmer months, I usually head outside to mow the lawn, do yard work, work on our vegetable garden.  I love to be outdoors as often as possible!  After lunch, I often head into town to get groceries, pick up mail, run errands, etc.  This takes about one hour or two.  I'm usually home by 3pm for a cup of coffee or green tea!  Kathleen usually arrives home anywhere from 4 to 5:30 pm, depending on whether she has meetings after work or not.  If the weather is cooperative, we often take a 20-minute walk down our quiet road to catch up on our day!  We have dinner at 6pm each evening - usually in the living room - while watching the news.  After the news, we watch Jeopardy until 7:30!  We then might chat with family members on the phone, watch additional television or catch up on paperwork.  Weekends are spent relaxing or visiting family or special events!  In late spring and throughout the summer, I usually play in a golf league on Monday nights.  Due to ongoing back issues, I don't believe I will continue to play in the league this year.  However, the back issues should not prevent me from becoming a puppy raiser.  This summer, Kathleen & I have two big events occurring.  One, is that we plan to travel to Ireland for two weeks to visit her parents and help her Mom celebrate her 80th birthday!  We also plan to put up a modular home right behind our current home.  The intention is that once the modular is up and ready for us to move in, we will then 'tear down' our former home.  We will continue to live at the same location and address.  So these will be two exciting events happening this year.  Kathleen & I are the only two people living at home.  We both have adult children from previous marriages.  We also have two grandchildren, ages 11 and 6.  Our 11-year-old granddaughter, Madison, lives in Central Valley and we only see her about 4-5 times throughout the year - mostly visiting her in Central Valley.  Madison lives with her Mom, a golden retriever, and 3 house cats.  Our other grandchild, is a boy.  Kaleb is 6-years old and he lives 5 miles away and we usually see him every Sunday.  Kaleb lives with his Mom and two small dogs, Diggy - who is a Jack Russell Terrier, and Maverick - a Chihuahua.  Usually Kaleb and his Mom visit us without their two dogs.  In my lifetime, I have had several pet dogs from the time I was a young boy up until 2 years ago, when Kathleen & I lost our last pet, Keiko to cancer.  Keiko was an American Eskimo dog and we had the good fortune of having him in our lives for 10 years.  My personality is very calm and patient and I love most animals, but I'm partial to dogs.   We both look forward to having another dog in our home and know that he will be in good and loving care when placed with us.  We also look forward to working with Nicole and becoming a part of the Guiding Eyes for the Blind community!"

I get ready and leave around 7:20 but my sleep schedule is easily flexible and I am confident that I will have no problem adjusting my sleeping time to helping my pup go to the bathroom etc. My school ends at 2:20 and I get home usually by walking or getting a ride by 2:35. I do my homework after relaxing for a while and it usually takes around 1-2 hours, sometimes more. In my free time I like to watch movies, go for walks near the beach, go to the gym, or hangout with friends. I shower, eat, and am usually in bed around 11.

We also have an 18 year old daughter who is a freshman in college in Pennsylvania who would be home on typical college breaks."

In any case, all of that is speculative.  Right now, my lifestyle consists primarily of my ongoing job search and a variety of hobbies.

I live alone on the first floor of a two family house and have sole use of the basement as well.  The property includes a pretty generous back yard for outside play as well.  I am 31 and physically fit, so the physical aspect of working with a puppy (small or large) does not present a concern.   I do have a six year old cat, who has had some exposure to dogs and sort of likes to play with them unless they get too close or too aggressive.  He's never had a dog stay in the house for more than a month or so at a time.  I have a very close knit family, so multiple family members are very close by (and several are neighbors), in addition to my girlfriend who is following along with the GEB curriculum and policies and wants to be involved in helping out.

The main things I want to make sure that GEB is able to work with me to get right are: socializing with other dogs (should the puppy be exposed to the poor untrained above mentioned dogs or avoid them to prevent being peer pressured into poor behavior?) and puppy proofing the house, in particular the basement (where the cat's litter is.)  Otherwise, the potential lifestyle change of a new job is the only item that could present a challenge.

I didn't see the precise information on this, but I had been told six months of weekly and the remainder every other week.  Either way is fine as more training is better, in my mind.      P.S.

My schedule is still flexible at this point. I will graduate in May, and plan to commute to a 4 year school in Fall 2015. I wake up at about 6:30-7:00am, to go to school or work, and am home no later than 5pm. I can come home mid-day to walk the pup. I usually run errands or relax at home after school, and go to sleep around 11pm.  I am a nanny to a 4 year-old girl and 2 year-old boy from 7:30am to 4:30pm, usually every Wednesday and occasional Mondays and Fridays. They have a 5 month-old, male Rottweiler puppy that I walk and feed mid-day sometimes. They will allow me to bring the pup for the first few months. I sometimes babysit Saturday afternoons for a family with 2 year-old twin boys and a 4 year-old girl. My work schedule is very flexible. It sounds very complicated, but really is not.  I live in a single-family home on 3/4 of an acre. We have an above ground pool which has a locked ladder when not in use.

I work every Monday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  At the present time, I have no other commitments.  The volunteer work is flexible and I can work 3 hours instead of 4 until the puppy can be left alone for a longer period of time.  Eventually, if it is acceptable to GEB, I would like the puppy to get therapy dog certification and be able to take the dog to the hospital with me when I volunteer.    My typical day begins at around 9 a.m.  I take out and feed my dog and then make my breakfast and read email and current events until about 1:30.  I eat lunch and take my dog for a walk, and exercise in my basement in the afternoon.  I cook and eat supper between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.  I go to the grocery store at least twice a week and usually go out to dinner with friends about once or twice a week.    Because my daughters live out of town, I try to travel to see them once a month, weather permitting. I travel by car to Cincinnati and either drive or fly to Washington, DC.  My daughter in Cincinnati has a husband and 2 children, ages 1 and 3.  Even though I live alone, my GEB puppy will be exposed to my young grandchildren and my 13 year old dog.  My daughter in DC also has a 10 year old dog who used to live with me and my dog before she moved to DC.  My daughter in Cincinnati lives in a semi rural area. And my other daughter lives in Silver Spring, MD and works in downtown DC.  We use the subway system when I am visiting her.    Since I spend much of my time alone, I am looking for other ways to help people and get out of the house.  A GEB puppy will give me reasons to go places and expose the puppy to new things.  I also look forward to being an ambassador for your organization and going to events in the area."

We love to see the animals in their natural habitat. Antartica and The Galagos are on my bucket list.    I work in Manhattan but currently i am in between jobs waiting out a non-compete period. This means i am at home until Feb 2015 when my new job will start. This has enabled me to spend a lot of time with the girls and also to get a few things done around the house. We lead an active lifestyle with the girls all playing team sports from soccer to LAX to field hockey and my wife and i make sure we keep ourselves working out too.   My parents had 2 Rottweilers when we were growing up and so i particularly can relate to some of the guidance shared in the STEP program and elsewhere. I am excited about the program but also very much aware of the time and effort commitment to the program."

I work 10 minutes away from my home at PepsiCo in Somers, NY.  I do get an hour lunch break which I generally take to work out but other people take for lunch and errands outside of the office.  Currently I am in the P3 program between PepsiCo and Guiding Eyes where we can socialize GE puppies at the office.  I would have to get approval to bring in older GE pups but I feel based on the ambassadors and managementÛªs knowledge and experience with this program that it could happen that I could bring the pup with me to work on certain days.  I am at a desk most of the time and occasionally have meetings that are not on a consistent schedule that could be moved around or taken over the phone so I feel like IÛªm in a position now it would allow me to have the flexibility to leave my desk to take the pup out to get busy or exercise.       On the weekends I stay within the area doing errands or hanging out with friends or boyfriend who is 10 mins away as well.  I like to spend my free time with my 5 year old dog going on walks around the block or park or taking her to the dog park if the weather is nice.      I live at home currently with my Mother and Father and we have 1 acre property but our yard is not fenced in.

Our house has 4 bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths, a basement playroom & mud room off the garage. We also have and a fenced-in back yard and live right near the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail which we use often for bike riding and running. We walk everywhere in town - to school, to the park, to the shops and to the train.    Kevin works in Manhattan, Malcolm, Ben & Harry all go to Farragut Middle School and I am home during the day or out running errands or exercising. In the afternoons, the kids come home to complete homework and have various activities (music, art & sports) that I drop off & pick them up from. We have family dinners at home almost every night. We have family visitors from California stay with us 4-5 times a year. The house is active & busy on the weekends with kids, neighbors & friends coming for play & family dinners. The kids play soccer on the weekends and Kevin coaches the team. We will have lots of time to walk the puppy daily and bring them to appropriate socialization activities.    Currently, we have no pets. The kids have taken care of several neighborhood cats and love it. We are all excited to raise a puppy and volunteer for Guiding Eyes. Years ago, Kevin & I lived in San Francisco and fostered a breeder, Cozy, from Guide Dogs in San Rafael.

In our home is myself, my 11 year old son, and I have a significant other that does not live with us but is in the home on a regular basis. We have two consistent baby sitters that we use for when I have to work in the evenings (once a week typically). We have a cat that is approximately 10 years old (not sure, we rescued her from the local shelter). This cat does not seem to be affected by much, including other dogs which have come to visit for long weekends, etc. (I have never seen a cat so un-fazed by anything!)

I have a per diem job that I work typically one evening a week that does not allow for any flexibility but my son would be home with the puppy with our sitter during that time.    I will be away on vacation/workshop/conference one week in April and I may need a puppy sitter during that week as it is not going to be possible to bring the puppy with me. Typically my parents come down and stay with my son during this week, but they will not be familiar with the training as they live several hours away from us. We usually go away for one or  two long weekends on ski trips during the late winter, so would probably need a sitter during those as well. We were planning a cross-country camping trip for next summer but we are hoping that we could take the puppy with us for that trip.    Weekends right now we do not have any set plans, in September my son will have a football game on one day for a couple of hours. During the winter (January through March) we ski weekends and that will be all day both days. It may be possible for us to bring the dog with us, I am on the ski patrol and have some flexibility during the day, but not always and this will be when we will probably need to have someone come in during the day to take the dog out.

We are currently looking to purchase a house and it is possible we will be living in a house in Fishkill within the next few months. Mark is an engineer for the power company and works consistently M-F from the hours of 7:30-4:30 in Newburgh, NY approximately 20 minutes from home. Mark can come home for lunch on certain days, (usually 1 or 2 per week) depending on meetings and other variables. Amanda has just finished her summer job and is looking for part or full-time employment close to home.     When Mark gets home from work, we will generally do something active together such as hiking, running road biking, or going to the gym. On the weekends, we generally exercise in the morning, do some household chores, shopping, etc. Some weekends we will drive up to the Catskills to do a longer hike. We generally cook dinner every night, going out to restaurants only occasionally. Afterwords we generally watch TV.     We occasionally go away for weekend trips, and our favorite place to go is Lake Placid. When we go there, we walk around town, go skiing, hiking, biking and running, and hang out at the local restaurants, many of which are dog friendly. (Ever hear of Ubu the dog? He is a staple for the area.)      We have a cockatiel named Henry who is very friendly and likes to chirp when the sun comes up. Sometimes we allow him to walk around the condo as long as we can keep an eye on where he is. Otherwise he is generally very happy just climbing around his cage and sitting on a perch. We clip his flight feathers regularly so he doesn't try to fly and hurt himself since he is very clumsy and would otherwise fly into things. He has lived with dogs before and is not fazed by them."

Also once a week, my mother comes over and we have a girlÛªs dinner in my apartment. IÛªm anticipating adding once a week puppy classes to my schedule as well.    As for weekends, I usually volunteer for Habitat for Humanity on Saturdays from about 8am-3pm. On Sundays, I have family dinners around 5:30pm with my mother and stepfather. Other than those two activities, my weekends do not have any regular structured activities.    IÛªm thinking a new schedule might look something like this:  6:30	  Wake Up  6:30-6:40	  Get busy/Stretch time  6:40-6:45	  Scarf down breakfast (Food bowl manners)  6:45-6:50	  Get busy #2  6:50-7:20	  Human breakfast and dress time, puppy teaching time  7:20-7:35	  Play time  7:35-7:45	  Quick walk  7:45-8:00	  Travel to Gym  8:00-9:00	  Personal Training/Workout  9:00-9:15	  Travel home  9:15-9:40	  Human getting ready time, puppy teaching time  9:40-9:45	  Get busy  10:00	  Work  2:00-2:30	  Lunch break, get busy, play time, get busy  6:00-10:30	  Get busy, play, teach, cuddle, play, teach, cuddle.    There really arenÛªt any activities I have where the puppy will not be allowed to join. For the weekly bill-pay nights, the neighborÛªs house is empty as she is with her husband in Florida as he is undergoing rehab. She has given permission for the puppy to stay with me in the house, which will be much desired company in the evenings there! None of my friends or family are allergic or otherwise opposed to dogs and therefore will be a welcomed addition for any guests I have at my apartment.    As for the weekends, as long as approved by Guiding Eyes, I believe the dog is welcome on building sites. The puppy will also be welcome to come with me to Sunday night dinners.     My best friend is a school teacher and therefore finishes her work day around 3pm and then picks up her four year old daughter, both of whom love dogs and have two of their own. I have discussed this endeavor with them and my best friend said they may be able to occasionally stop by and visit with the puppy in the late afternoons before I get home. My mother is retired and often comes to Salisbury for meetings and errands, she may also be able to stop in and show the puppy some love every once in a while. I live on the same property as the couple I rent from and the husband is starting retirement. I anticipate he will be available if any extreme emergencies arise where I am unable to get home at the necessary time.    The apartment IÛªm living in is a studio apartment which is just enough room for one single person. While there isnÛªt a tremendous amount of space in the apartment, the property IÛªm on is very large, safe, and quiet. It will be the perfect place to play with the puppy and allow him or her to romp around under supervision. Since I live alone, many evenings can feel lonely and IÛªm very excited to be able to have time and energy at this point in my life to be able to devote myself to a puppy who will grow up to become an extremely helpful friend for someone in need."

On a typical weekday during the school year, I teach at a middle school and our two teenagers of course go to school as well.  We leave at 7:15 AM and return around 3PM.  Sports, exercise, and perhaps a few errands happen in the afternoon.  My husband is a professor at UConn and has a very flexible schedule.  He teaches two days a week from 11 to 1:30, and then he has a night class from 6 to 9 PM one day a week.  He is home most of the time, reading, researching, writing, but also makes time to walk our seven year old yellow lab, Popcorn, to do some food shopping as needed, and to take the kids to their activities in the afternoon.  He teaches mostly from the West Hartford campus, but he goes out to Storrs periodically for meetings.     On the weekends we shuttle the kids around to friends' houses and activities, do a little shopping, a little cooking, relaxing, some entertaining, and we go to church.  Sometimes our kids have sports tournaments, but usually only one parent attends as they can be quite long (from my perspective!).    Summer plans vary, but usually include a trip.  This August we are headed to Peru from the 11th to 21st, and we are taking a quick roadtrip to D.C.  Popcorn always comes with us on roadtrips; she has traveled to Kansas, North Carolina, Maine, and even to Quebec City where she rode the funicular.  She is an indispensable part of our family and we hate to leave her behind.      We live in West Hartford, in a tranquil, wooded area that is perfect for long walks.  We have a favorite path around a lake that is about 2.5 miles.  Popcorn does this walk almost every morning with my husband, and then I take her out in the afternoon or evening for a different, shorter walk.  The kids often come along. Popcorn has had issues with her knees, so we are careful to keep her weight down and follow her cues for how far she wants to walk.  Most days she walks at least 3 miles.      The rest of us are perfectly healthy!  We are an active family in one sense, yet there is almost always someone home at our house, especially since the kids are old enough to be home by themselves.  We enjoy being home, especially just hanging out and playing with the dog.      In terms of our GEB puppy, we would definitely want a Lab.  The Labs we have owned have all come from reputable breeders of English-style dogs, and we've looked for breeders who focus on temperament in addition to looks.  We've never been interested in showing a dog, but we do appreciate a dog that conforms to breed standards.  I grew up with copies of Labrador Quarterly laying about; it's just in my blood to gravitate towards a stocky Lab with a big head.  So in the looks department we would absolutely adore a British style pup of any color except fox red.  We've always had females, but would be willing to take a male if there is a need.  As far as temperament, we can certainly handle the feistiest of young pups, but I'm not sure our own dog could handle the most energetic pup of the litter.    Thank you so much for this opportunity!  We know that volunteers don't get to pick the pups, but I thought you would want to know the biases that we bring to this project (my husband has jokingly called me a dog Nazi) so that you can make the best match for us and set us up for success.  We will, without a doubt, love whichever dog comes our way."

She is an indispensable part of our family and we hate to leave her behind.      We live in West Hartford, in a tranquil, wooded area that is perfect for long walks.  We have a favorite path around a lake that is about 2.5 miles.  Popcorn does this walk almost every morning with my husband, and then I take her out in the afternoon or evening for a different, shorter walk.  The kids often come along. Popcorn has had issues with her knees, so we are careful to keep her weight down and follow her cues for how far she wants to walk.  Most days she walks at least 3 miles.      The rest of us are perfectly healthy!  We are an active family in one sense, yet there is almost always someone home at our house, especially since the kids are old enough to be home by themselves.  We enjoy being home, especially just hanging out and playing with the dog.      In terms of our GEB puppy, we would definitely want a Lab.  The Labs we have owned have all come from reputable breeders of English-style dogs, and we've looked for breeders who focus on temperament in addition to looks.  We've never been interested in showing a dog, but we do appreciate a dog that conforms to breed standards.  I grew up with copies of Labrador Quarterly laying about; it's just in my blood to gravitate towards a stocky Lab with a big head.  So in the looks department we would absolutely adore a British style pup of any color except fox red.  We've always had females, but would be willing to take a male if there is a need.  As far as temperament, we can certainly handle the feistiest of young pups, but I'm not sure our own dog could handle the most energetic pup of the litter.    Thank you so much for this opportunity!  We know that volunteers don't get to pick the pups, but I thought you would want to know the biases that we bring to this project (my husband has jokingly called me a dog Nazi) so that you can make the best match for us and set us up for success.  We will, without a doubt, love whichever dog comes our way."

We regularly play tennis at a fenced in court (and have had fun with a dog we are sitting there).

I live in a 2-bedroom house on Cape Cod with my husband Tony and our two cats, Judge and Heathbar. I work as postdoc in geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, while Tony stays home, takes care of the housework, and volunteers with local animal rescue organizations. Although I work full time, I set my own hours and my schedule is very flexible. Some weeks, I work mostly on data analysis and writing. Those weeks, I typically go in to work Monday through Friday, 9-5, though aside from occasional seminars and lab meetings, it is possible for me to work from home many of those days if necessary (e.g., when we puppy-sit, I work from home while Tony does his volunteer shifts). Other weeks, when I am working in the lab, I typically work long days, 6 or 7 days a week, and may head into work as early as 6am and stay in lab as late as midnight. However, even those weeks, my schedule is fairly flexible, and it's not unusual for me to take a 1-2 hour break to play sports in the afternoon, run errands, or come home to eat dinner.    On a typical weekday, I will wake up around 6:30, make myself breakfast and read my email until about 7:30 or 8am. If I don't have any other sports/exercise plans later in the day, I will go for a jog if the weather is nice or ride my bike on an indoor trainer for half an hour or so if it's nasty out. If the weather is nice I will bike the 4 miles to work, otherwise I will drive or have Tony drop me off around 8:30-9:30am. At work, if I'm not busy with a project in lab, I spend most of my time in office, working on my computer, but I also attend one or two meetings per week. My workplace is very dog-friendly - it's very common to see a dog napping under someone's desk or wandering in the hall to visit people, there's an enclosed courtyard garden just steps from my office, and the campus is large and crossed with walking trails through rolling hills. However, I would probably not routinely bring a GEB pup to work with me because Tony could provide more stimulation at home and around town, and it also would not be safe to take the dog into the laboratory (chemicals, broken glass, very expensive instruments). In the afternoon, I will usual take about an hour break for exercise: sometimes Tony comes and plays tennis with me at work, or sometimes I will go for a jog or bike ride nearby, or swim at a local pool. Around 5 or 6, I come home and have dinner with Tony. Activities in the evening include biking on the trainer, jogging, or swimming if I haven't gotten any exercise yet that day, watching an episode or two of a sitcom with Tony, goofing on the internet, and some light chores. We're usually in bed by 10 or 10:30pm. Very few things in our shared weekly routine are formally scheduled aside from volleyball at the rec center form 6:30-9pm on Tuesdays and touch football in the park on Thursdays from 5-7 or Sundays from 11-1.    Weekends are even more flexible, and we usually fill them with projects around the house, long bike rides, day hikes in the woods, reading in a comfy chair while cuddling the cats, and generally living the good life. Now that the weather is finally getting warm, we're looking forward to spending a lot more time outside, working on our container garden on our deck, clamming, and swimming at the beach (which is a 3 minute walk from our house).    Our cats have been pretty good with the (older) pups we've puppy-sat for so far. We keep the cat food and cat litter in the second bedroom, so we do not allow dogs in there.

I live in a 2-bedroom house on Cape Cod with my husband Tony and our two cats, Judge and Heathbar. I work as postdoc in geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, while Tony stays home, takes care of the housework, and volunteers with local animal rescue organizations. Although I work full time, I set my own hours and my schedule is very flexible. Some weeks, I work mostly on data analysis and writing. Those weeks, I typically go in to work Monday through Friday, 9-5, though aside from occasional seminars and lab meetings, it is possible for me to work from home many of those days if necessary (e.g., when we puppy-sit, I work from home while Tony does his volunteer shifts). Other weeks, when I am working in the lab, I typically work long days, 6 or 7 days a week, and may head into work as early as 6am and stay in lab as late as midnight. However, even those weeks, my schedule is fairly flexible, and it's not unusual for me to take a 1-2 hour break to play sports in the afternoon, run errands, or come home to eat dinner.    On a typical weekday, I will wake up around 6:30, make myself breakfast and read my email until about 7:30 or 8am. If I don't have any other sports/exercise plans later in the day, I will go for a jog if the weather is nice or ride my bike on an indoor trainer for half an hour or so if it's nasty out. If the weather is nice I will bike the 4 miles to work, otherwise I will drive or have Tony drop me off around 8:30-9:30am. At work, if I'm not busy with a project in lab, I spend most of my time in office, working on my computer, but I also attend one or two meetings per week. My workplace is very dog-friendly - it's very common to see a dog napping under someone's desk or wandering in the hall to visit people, there's an enclosed courtyard garden just steps from my office, and the campus is large and crossed with walking trails through rolling hills. However, I would probably not routinely bring a GEB pup to work with me because Tony could provide more stimulation at home and around town, and it also would not be safe to take the dog into the laboratory (chemicals, broken glass, very expensive instruments). In the afternoon, I will usual take about an hour break for exercise: sometimes Tony comes and plays tennis with me at work, or sometimes I will go for a jog or bike ride nearby, or swim at a local pool. Around 5 or 6, I come home and have dinner with Tony. Activities in the evening include biking on the trainer, jogging, or swimming if I haven't gotten any exercise yet that day, watching an episode or two of a sitcom with Tony, goofing on the internet, and some light chores.

I have been a stay at home Mom for the past 23 years.  My husband owns a business with his partner and they repair european automobiles.  They have done well and grown over the past 19 years.  Our three children are in college.  The two oldest will graduate in May and our youngest will be a sophomore this fall. Three years ago my Mom relocated to the Cape from Pennsylvania.  She was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer eight years ago.  She started needing a little help and wanted to be closer to me.  You never would have known she had cancer, she managed to live without the horrible consequences cancer can sometimes bring.  However, this past September she passed away.  Her batteries simply ran out.  She did however live out her life with her positive spirit, happy personality, dignity and simply never gave into her illness.   The last four months of her life she stayed in our home, again you never would have know she had anything wrong, she was a pleasure to have around.  She loved the company of the children, my husband, me and our dog.  So, I have gone from being a mom, attending countless swim meets for 17 years and then being responsible for my Mom's well being to having time I never had before.  My mothering will never end, however the day to day responsibilities are now different.  I have countless projects that are finally getting done and although I am busy I have time I haven't had before.    Being able to give my mother the comfort of being at home during the end of her life gives me great peace.  All she wanted was to be at home with family, I am thankful we were able to do that.  She loved her independence and ability to keep it as long as she could.  I think of the blind person wanting the same thing.  I would like nothing more than to help in a dogs journey to becoming that independence for someone.      Let me briefly tell you about our dog Ollie.  He is a well exercised (I try and walk 5-6 miles each day), 8 year old, 100 pound English lab.  He is nothing less than part of our family.  He has a dog bed in every room that the family may gather.  His job in life has been loving his family.  If he is leaning on your foot he is content.  Everyone in the family is responsible for Ollie's well being. We bring Ollie wherever and wherever we can.  We are what I call very responsible dog owners.      I do believe at this time in my life I have the opportunity to give something back.  My time is free and my discipline and dedication is unmeasured.  I am a goal setter, I have run many a marathon with two goals, do better than the last time and finish.  My goal with a pup of course would have one goal, graduate to helping a blind person.        I don't know what I can say to help with the match of a pup in our home.  I believe Ollie will be welcoming as he is with meeting most dogs but perhaps a male is better than a female just to keep the peace.

I have been a stay at home Mom for the past 23 years.  My husband owns a business with his partner and they repair european automobiles.  They have done well and grown over the past 19 years.  Our three children are in college.  The two oldest will graduate in May and our youngest will be a sophomore this fall. Three years ago my Mom relocated to the Cape from Pennsylvania.  She was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer eight years ago.  She started needing a little help and wanted to be closer to me.  You never would have known she had cancer, she managed to live without the horrible consequences cancer can sometimes bring.  However, this past September she passed away.  Her batteries simply ran out.  She did however live out her life with her positive spirit, happy personality, dignity and simply never gave into her illness.   The last four months of her life she stayed in our home, again you never would have know she had anything wrong, she was a pleasure to have around.  She loved the company of the children, my husband, me and our dog.  So, I have gone from being a mom, attending countless swim meets for 17 years and then being responsible for my Mom's well being to having time I never had before.  My mothering will never end, however the day to day responsibilities are now different.  I have countless projects that are finally getting done and although I am busy I have time I haven't had before.    Being able to give my mother the comfort of being at home during the end of her life gives me great peace.  All she wanted was to be at home with family, I am thankful we were able to do that.  She loved her independence and ability to keep it as long as she could.  I think of the blind person wanting the same thing.  I would like nothing more than to help in a dogs journey to becoming that independence for someone.      Let me briefly tell you about our dog Ollie.  He is a well exercised (I try and walk 5-6 miles each day), 8 year old, 100 pound English lab.  He is nothing less than part of our family.  He has a dog bed in every room that the family may gather.  His job in life has been loving his family.  If he is leaning on your foot he is content.  Everyone in the family is responsible for Ollie's well being. We bring Ollie wherever and wherever we can.  We are what I call very responsible dog owners.      I do believe at this time in my life I have the opportunity to give something back.  My time is free and my discipline and dedication is unmeasured.  I am a goal setter, I have run many a marathon with two goals, do better than the last time and finish.  My goal with a pup of course would have one goal, graduate to helping a blind person.        I don't know what I can say to help with the match of a pup in our home.  I believe Ollie will be welcoming as he is with meeting most dogs but perhaps a male is better than a female just to keep the peace.  We are here to help and hope you will consider us for pup placement.     Carol Cavanaugh"

But at the same time I love to relax and sit back and take the time to think about my day. After I get up, like I said, I like to workout. Then I may read a book outside and eat lunch. I spend most of my days in the summer outside and with other people too. I do  not live on a main road, I live in a neighborhood that has a long street that is perfect for running, and I live right next to a beautiful park, that unfortunately, but to my benefit, no one uses. When school comes around I wake up at six fifteen and get ready for school, but I am totally willing to get up earlier to take my puppy out to get busy and go for a walk. When I am at school my mom will be letting the puppy out and feeding it it's lunch. When I get home I will play with the puppy more and take It out and for a walk. When basketball season starts, although I am not sure that I am going to be doing basketball, I am usually home at seven at night, but I wake up and would do the same routine with the puppy in the morning, my mom is home most of the day will take care of it when I am at basketball too. I have an older dog who has bad joints so if there is a puppy who does not jump excessively that would be wonderful for my 11 year old golden retriever. I know my family and I were thinking of a German shepherd but I am really into the thought of getting a lab."

In the main office area, I sit with a co-worker, Grace, who also has dogs and is willing to help me with the puppy when I have meetings or am involved with another student.  I have about 1-3 meetings each week lasting an hour.  Our school does not have a nurse, so Grace and I handle student illness, cuts, scrapes, etc. as well.  In the past, I have provided first aid, CPR and AED training.  Grace handles the cuts, scrapes, etc.  I tend to handle the big stuff such as administering an Epi-pen.  We also have a diabetic student which I help administer or test approx. once a day which takes about 5-10 minutes. The main part of my job is development work and is very flexible.  I have permission from our headmaster, Randy Hollister, to bring the puppy with me to work each day.  In our office there are 7-8 people who have additionally said they would be willing to help with the puppy.  I tend to work from 8:15-5pm.  I typically work the last two weeks of August until the third week of June and a couple of days in July.  The summer hours are 9am-3pm.  The puppy/crate would be by my desk, but out of the way.  I do not work in a classroom or have any set times that I am watching students.  However, I plan to take full advantage of having all these people around for the puppy to meet!    Our family lives in a rural area. We have about 30 acres which is mainly wooded.  We have 2 labs; Blackie has had 5 litters and we kept one from the first litter, Vader.  Both are females and not neutered.  Blackie is 12 years old and Vader is 9 years old.  Both have outside kennels and until this past cold winter, stayed outside all year around.  Blackie is slowing down and so we kept them in the kitchen area most of the winter.  We have an open floor plan but taught them to stay in the kitchen area.  With the warm weather, they are back outside all the time now.  However, the puppy would be with us wherever we are in the house.  We also have two cats, our mousers, Santa and Mrs. Claus.  They are also mostly outside except on cold winter nights.  Mrs. Claus and Vader are often seen licking each other!  Our cats are used to puppies and our dogs are as well.  We have not fenced in our yard, but have kennels and an extra kennel we used when we were raising Blackie's puppies.  When outside and not on a leash, we would use this extra kennel.  We are working to fence in our yard because of all of the deer in our area, but have only started that project.     My husband often works from home and will keep the puppy home when I can't bring the puppy to work. He has raised several dogs and is very interested to learn how it's done with Guiding Eyes.  Alex is a sophomore at Virginia Tech and will be home for the summer in May.  His plans aren't set yet, so we're not sure how much he'll be home for helping with the training.  Leland is a junior in high school and leads the NJROTC drill team.  They practice each day from 4-5pm. He also takes guitar lessons.  Leland is really looking forward to help raising the puppy.  Besides me, he will be doing a lot of the training.  He hasn't been able to take the classes because of his school exams, but I've been going over the material with him.    I work out 4-6 times a week, twice a week with a trainer.  He said I could bring the puppy there.  We do not generally go running, but if we do, I'd make other arrangements for the puppy.  The other workout times are at home in the morning or evening for 30-45 minutes.      I also volunteer for our church. We are considering expanding our facilities and I am on the finance portion of the building committee.  We meet after church on Sundays twice a month for about an hour and half.  I also help out with the youth group who meet Sunday evenings for a couple of hours.  We have often taken Blackie's puppies to them and to school for socialization, so they are used to this from our family!    On the weekends, I'm either running errands, playing in the garden, going to concerts (we are music fans!), or getting together with friends.    Most of my schedule and my family's schedule is flexible.  I don't see us having blocks of time when the puppy will be crated and alone.  If I had something going on at school, my husband would either work from home or take the puppy with him to his work.  He has a separate closed door office and a co-worker has one of our pups from Blackie.  My main concern for the puppy is being able to take the puppy to work with me each day in an open office area and being around PK-8th grade children.  I think this will work.  I know I will have to expand my hours a bit to do the training and bathroom breaks.  And I have taken several batches of 1-8 week old puppies to school for a few hours, but haven't taken a single puppy to work for several months and would welcome any suggestions!    We are all looking forward to this opportunity.  Thank you so very much for considering us!"

Edward is the prospective primary puppy raiser and Laura is the secondary raiser.    Ed is going through a life change and raising a puppy is part of the plan.  Ed is transitioning into retirement following a 40-plus year career working for the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.  ItÛªs been difficult to decide when to retire, but the commitment of being a puppy raiser is making it easier.  Once the puppy arrives, Ed will continue with some consulting work from home, but the puppy becomes priority number one!    Laura is retired and was a bookkeeper and office manager for various companies over her career.    Our son lives and works in Ashburn, VA, approximately 1.5-hour drive away.  He has two children that live in Oklahoma City and they come to visit us about twice a year.    We do not currently own a dog, but have three cats.  We both love dogs, but our daily work schedules and EdÛªs frequent business travel didnÛªt lend itself to proper dog raising.     Typical Day:  We both expect to be home most every day.  We typically get up early and go to bed early.  It normally starts about 5:00 am, workdays and weekends, and ends by 10:00 pm.  Ed usually makes most of the meals.   Ed plans to do consulting work at home during the morning hours.      Lifestyle:  Ed and Laura have a quiet relaxed lifestyle, that is, until the grandchildren visit.  We are both non-smokers.  EdÛªs hobbies include bicycle riding and he spends lots of time working in the yard and on other home projects.  LauraÛªs hobbies include reading, especially mystery novels, and quilting.  Although sheÛªs a cat person, Laura hasnÛªt met a dog she didnÛªt like.  She always enjoys greeting and playing with the Weimaraner who lives next door.    Work schedule:  EdÛªs work plan following retirement will consist of consulting work from home averaging about 12 hours per week, with occasional visits to business offices.  The schedule is totally flexible.    Weekend schedule:  Ed and LauraÛªs weekend schedule is open format.  There are weekend shopping trips usually on Saturday mornings.  We attend church on a weekly basis.    Home setting:  Our home is in a residential community near Annapolis, MD.  The homes are on large lots (~2 acres) so there is plenty of open space.  There are many children in the neighborhood, the elementary school is nearby, and the school bus stop is down the street.   Most of our neighbors have dogs and there are many dog-walkers.  Our neighbors have offered encouragement and support for us becoming a puppy raiser.    What led us to Guiding Eyes for the Blind:  After not having had a dog for many years, the desire for a dog came to me (Ed) in a surprising way.  Several years ago on a bicycle ride in southern Maryland I came across this dog that I still think about.  At the time, I was alone on a rural road within sight of the Chesapeake Bay.  After making a turn at this scenic place, there was this chocolate Labrador Retriever standing behind a fence silently watching me.  I came to within a few feet of the dog, made eye contact, and connected with him/her instantly.  I thought what a beautiful animal!  I continued riding, a changed person.    Recently, several people brought service dogs in training to the office.  One of these people happened to be a dog-sitter for Guiding Eyes for the Blind, Montgomery Region, and I felt that connection again with her black Labrador Retriever.  I told myself, ÛÏI need to get one of these dogs.Û  So here I am."

James, Rosie and Mairead are all Homeschooled)    5:30 a.m. Dellie (the Papillion) wakes Bob (Dad Betker) to go out to go potty.  6:00 a.m. Bob gets up for work  7:15 a.m. Bob leaves for work  7:30-ish Colleen (Mom Betker) gets up. Let's dogs Dellie and Jessie (the pound hound) outside again. Mostly to check for squirrels.  8:00-ish James, Rosie and Mairead are woken up.  8:30-ish Kids come down and start getting breakfast.  9:00-ish Kids should be heading upstairs to shower and change.  9:30-ish Kids should be heading down to start schoolwork.  10:00-ish Kids are finally downstairs and starting on schoolwork.  11:30-ish Kids take a break and if they haven't already they will often take the dogs for a quick walk.  12:00 to 4:00 Kids work on schoolwork and take small breaks as necessary and get lunch when hungry.  4:00 p.m. Kids can use electronics for leisure  6:00-ish Bob gets home from work and family dinner is served. After family dinner dogs are fed.  Somewhere between end of dinner and 8:00p.m. Family gets together for prayers.  9:00 p.m. Mairead and Rosie get ready for bed.  10:00 p.m. Girls finally settled down and go to sleep.   10:00 p.m. James gets first call for bed, which means he goes downstairs for a snack  10:00-ish Colleen goes to sleep  11:00 p.m. James get lights out call (if still awake.) Bob let's dogs out for final time and comes up for bed.  11:30 Bob goes to sleep    Jessie and Dellie are let out periodically throughout the day on an as needed basis. (They let us know when they want/need to go out.) Mostly they go out to check the yard for invading squirrels or such.  Dogs sleep most of the day just waking periodically to check out what is going on in the house.    Û¢	Jessie is our calm, happy, laid back 45 lb. All American Dog.  We got her from the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, when she was about a year.  She is now about 11 years old, but does not show any significant signs of aging.  She loves attention and is a real Daddies girl. (When Bob went to Iraq poor Jessie became very sad and melancholy, pining for her Dad. Thankfully she recovered once he returned. She loves to follow him all over the house as he does his chores on the weekends.) During the school day Jessie usually sleeps upstairs on whatever kid blankets have been left on the floor, or sometimes in the open kennel in the kitchen. Jessie mostly likes to snuggle on the floor with James at night. (Yes, James sleeps on the floor.  I think he does it now, just to get around the rule of, ""No dogs on the beds."") Even though she loves to be with James, she does make her rounds to each bedroom at some point during the night.  Jessie is what most people would die for in family dog.  She loves having her head and neck scratched, and when happy (which is most of the time) her tail wags a million miles a minute.  She also loves carrying the kidÛªs stuffed animals around the house.  She never chews on them or destroys them, just sweetly carries them around.  She also rarely barks.  In fact, she didnÛªt bark at all for the first few years, but now occasionally barks at critters in the yard.  She has also been know to hide behind trees waiting for the squirrels to come down so she can chase them off again.    Û¢	Dellie, our hefty 13 lb. Papillion, on the other hand is feistier. She affectionately goes by the nickname, fuzz-ball and suffers from the typical small dog mentality; I'm really a Great Dane in disguise. Dellie generally stays downstairs during the school day with Mom and kids or goes to her post on the stairs where she can monitor anyone passing in front of the house while still keeping an eye on the family. (Dellie has delusions of grandeur and fancies herself the great family protector.) Dellie tends to bark a little, mostly when she sees someone walking their dog down the street or when someone comes to the door.  Dellie, although not hyper, is more active than Jessie, especially in the yard.  Rosie is Dellie's favorite person. They bonded early when Dellie figured out that Rosie typically left a trail of food wherever she goes.  Dellie, although not aggressive, does not warm up to other dogs instantaneously. Even though we have had a number of ÛÏfosterÛ dogs through our house in the past few years, it still takes her a few days for her to get used to the idea of a new invader.  Once she is satisfied that the new dog knows she is top dog in the house she settles down.    Scheduled Activities:    Û¢	Monday, Tuesday and Thursday we try (emphasis on try) to reserve exclusively for schoolwork. (But would also be flexible during this time to incorporate puppy needs.)  o	James has Boy Scouts on Monday evenings from 7:00 to 8:15.  (To accommodate this, one of the kids and Colleen will drive Bob to work in the morning. We will leave about 7:15 and be back around 8:30 a.m. Then at 4:30 one of the kids and Colleen will go back and pick up Bob from work so Bob has time to have dinner before taking James to Boy Scouts.)  o	Rosie and Mairead will take a Pottery class though Fairfax County Recreation from 2:30 to 4:00 on Mondays, from March 31 through June 2, 2014. James will stay home. (Might be an opportunity here for socializing.)    Û¢	Wednesdays are our activities day and go generally as follows:  o	9:20 - Rosie, Mairead and Colleen leave for horseback riding lessons. James stays home to work on schoolwork.  o	11:20 - We swing by the house to pick up James and karate gear and head off for karate lessons.  o	2:00-ish - We swing by the house to drop off the girls and James and I head over to Fort Belvoir for his teen group meeting.  o	4:20 - James and I leave Fort Belvoir to go home.   o	(However, once or twice a month on Wednesday Bob and I go out for ""Life Counseling."" On those Wednesday's, once James and I leave Fort Belvoir, we will head to downtown D.C. to go pick up Bob from work. If it is one of the weeks to pick up Bob, we will then head home to drop-off James and then Bob and I go out. Kids fend for themselves for dinner, James takes care of the dogs and Bob and I return around 8:30.).    Û¢	On Friday's the kids and Mom attend an educational co-op with other homeschoolers at Good Shepherd Church in Mount Vernon.  We leave the house around 8:30 a.m. and return around 1:00 p.m. The spring program ends May 2, 2014 and doesnÛªt resume until fall 2014.    Û¢	Weekends are unpredictable. We do not currently have any regularly scheduled activities. So, on weekends we try to get the house cleaned up (or relatively so) and do any running around and errands that need to be done. Anything that will help reduce the strain on the weekdays. Dellie still wakes Bob up around 5:30 to go potty and check the yard, Mom still gets up around 7:00-7:30, but Bob and kids grab a few extra winks and tend to get up on their own somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00, 10:00 at the very latest. Bedtime tend to remain the same as weekdays.    Û¢	Summer is also unpredictable.  In the past we have done swim team or other activities or camps during the summer, along with a quick excursion to the beach at some point.  In the past, we have also typically taken a family vacation to Vermont the third week in July.  This summer the only thing on the schedule thus far is Boy Scout Camp for James the second week in July. Kids seem to prefer the unstructured, low-key summer to those of the past.  (BobÛªs father died over the winter and Bob used a good bit of his leave.  So we currently are unsure if we will be able to take a family vacation this summer.)    In the past I would have described our house as loud and active, but somewhere in the past year or so as the kids have gotten more into their electronics and started to headed towards their teens, both the activity level and noise level have dropped significantly.  So although Bob and I often feel like we are being pulled in several directions, overall house has slowed down.     Lastly, we have one daughter away at college.  She is 23 years old and is finishing her Bachelors in Sign Language Interpretation at Towson University in Maryland.  She has her own apartment and works full-time in addition to going to school.  Because of her busy schedule she doesnÛªt get to stop by the house as often as she would like.  Her visits tend to be two or three quick stops by the house during the week and then no visits for two or three weeks.  She is expected to graduate from Towson in the Spring of 2015 but will probably not return to the house to live after graduation.    Sorry about the length, being brief has never been my strong suit.  And you said, Û_ ÛÏleave a novel.Û"

(BobÛªs father died over the winter and Bob used a good bit of his leave.  So we currently are unsure if we will be able to take a family vacation this summer.)    In the past I would have described our house as loud and active, but somewhere in the past year or so as the kids have gotten more into their electronics and started to headed towards their teens, both the activity level and noise level have dropped significantly.  So although Bob and I often feel like we are being pulled in several directions, overall house has slowed down.     Lastly, we have one daughter away at college.  She is 23 years old and is finishing her Bachelors in Sign Language Interpretation at Towson University in Maryland.  She has her own apartment and works full-time in addition to going to school.  Because of her busy schedule she doesnÛªt get to stop by the house as often as she would like.  Her visits tend to be two or three quick stops by the house during the week and then no visits for two or three weeks.  She is expected to graduate from Towson in the Spring of 2015 but will probably not return to the house to live after graduation.

James, Rosie and Mairead are all Homeschooled)    5:30 a.m. Dellie (the Papillion) wakes Bob (Dad Betker) to go out to go potty.  6:00 a.m. Bob gets up for work  7:15 a.m. Bob leaves for work  7:30-ish Colleen (Mom Betker) gets up. Let's dogs Dellie and Jessie (the pound hound) outside again. Mostly to check for squirrels.  8:00-ish James, Rosie and Mairead are woken up.  8:30-ish Kids come down and start getting breakfast.  9:00-ish Kids should be heading upstairs to shower and change.  9:30-ish Kids should be heading down to start schoolwork.  10:00-ish Kids are finally downstairs and starting on schoolwork.  11:30-ish Kids take a break and if they haven't already they will often take the dogs for a quick walk.  12:00 to 4:00 Kids work on schoolwork and take small breaks as necessary and get lunch when hungry.  4:00 p.m. Kids can use electronics for leisure  6:00-ish Bob gets home from work and family dinner is served. After family dinner dogs are fed.  Somewhere between end of dinner and 8:00p.m. Family gets together for prayers.  9:00 p.m. Mairead and Rosie get ready for bed.  10:00 p.m. Girls finally settled down and go to sleep.   10:00 p.m. James gets first call for bed, which means he goes downstairs for a snack  10:00-ish Colleen goes to sleep  11:00 p.m. James get lights out call (if still awake.) Bob let's dogs out for final time and comes up for bed.  11:30 Bob goes to sleep    Jessie and Dellie are let out periodically throughout the day on an as needed basis. (They let us know when they want/need to go out.) Mostly they go out to check the yard for invading squirrels or such.  Dogs sleep most of the day just waking periodically to check out what is going on in the house.    Û¢	Jessie is our calm, happy, laid back 45 lb. All American Dog.  We got her from the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, when she was about a year.  She is now about 11 years old, but does not show any significant signs of aging.  She loves attention and is a real Daddies girl. (When Bob went to Iraq poor Jessie became very sad and melancholy, pining for her Dad. Thankfully she recovered once he returned. She loves to follow him all over the house as he does his chores on the weekends.) During the school day Jessie usually sleeps upstairs on whatever kid blankets have been left on the floor, or sometimes in the open kennel in the kitchen. Jessie mostly likes to snuggle on the floor with James at night. (Yes, James sleeps on the floor.  I think he does it now, just to get around the rule of, ""No dogs on the beds."") Even though she loves to be with James, she does make her rounds to each bedroom at some point during the night.  Jessie is what most people would die for in family dog.  She loves having her head and neck scratched, and when happy (which is most of the time) her tail wags a million miles a minute.  She also loves carrying the kidÛªs stuffed animals around the house.  She never chews on them or destroys them, just sweetly carries them around.  She also rarely barks.  In fact, she didnÛªt bark at all for the first few years, but now occasionally barks at critters in the yard.  She has also been know to hide behind trees waiting for the squirrels to come down so she can chase them off again.    Û¢	Dellie, our hefty 13 lb. Papillion, on the other hand is feistier. She affectionately goes by the nickname, fuzz-ball and suffers from the typical small dog mentality; I'm really a Great Dane in disguise. Dellie generally stays downstairs during the school day with Mom and kids or goes to her post on the stairs where she can monitor anyone passing in front of the house while still keeping an eye on the family. (Dellie has delusions of grandeur and fancies herself the great family protector.) Dellie tends to bark a little, mostly when she sees someone walking their dog down the street or when someone comes to the door.  Dellie, although not hyper, is more active than Jessie, especially in the yard.  Rosie is Dellie's favorite person. They bonded early when Dellie figured out that Rosie typically left a trail of food wherever she goes.  Dellie, although not aggressive, does not warm up to other dogs instantaneously. Even though we have had a number of ÛÏfosterÛ dogs through our house in the past few years, it still takes her a few days for her to get used to the idea of a new invader.  Once she is satisfied that the new dog knows she is top dog in the house she settles down.    Scheduled Activities:    Û¢	Monday, Tuesday and Thursday we try (emphasis on try) to reserve exclusively for schoolwork. (But would also be flexible during this time to incorporate puppy needs.)  o	James has Boy Scouts on Monday evenings from 7:00 to 8:15.  (To accommodate this, one of the kids and Colleen will drive Bob to work in the morning. We will leave about 7:15 and be back around 8:30 a.m. Then at 4:30 one of the kids and Colleen will go back and pick up Bob from work so Bob has time to have dinner before taking James to Boy Scouts.)  o	Rosie and Mairead will take a Pottery class though Fairfax County Recreation from 2:30 to 4:00 on Mondays, from March 31 through June 2, 2014. James will stay home. (Might be an opportunity here for socializing.)    Û¢	Wednesdays are our activities day and go generally as follows:  o	9:20 - Rosie, Mairead and Colleen leave for horseback riding lessons. James stays home to work on schoolwork.  o	11:20 - We swing by the house to pick up James and karate gear and head off for karate lessons.  o	2:00-ish - We swing by the house to drop off the girls and James and I head over to Fort Belvoir for his teen group meeting.  o	4:20 - James and I leave Fort Belvoir to go home.   o	(However, once or twice a month on Wednesday Bob and I go out for ""Life Counseling."" On those Wednesday's, once James and I leave Fort Belvoir, we will head to downtown D.C. to go pick up Bob from work. If it is one of the weeks to pick up Bob, we will then head home to drop-off James and then Bob and I go out. Kids fend for themselves for dinner, James takes care of the dogs and Bob and I return around 8:30.).    Û¢	On Friday's the kids and Mom attend an educational co-op with other homeschoolers at Good Shepherd Church in Mount Vernon.  We leave the house around 8:30 a.m. and return around 1:00 p.m. The spring program ends May 2, 2014 and doesnÛªt resume until fall 2014.    Û¢	Weekends are unpredictable. We do not currently have any regularly scheduled activities. So, on weekends we try to get the house cleaned up (or relatively so) and do any running around and errands that need to be done. Anything that will help reduce the strain on the weekdays. Dellie still wakes Bob up around 5:30 to go potty and check the yard, Mom still gets up around 7:00-7:30, but Bob and kids grab a few extra winks and tend to get up on their own somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00, 10:00 at the very latest. Bedtime tend to remain the same as weekdays.    Û¢	Summer is also unpredictable.  In the past we have done swim team or other activities or camps during the summer, along with a quick excursion to the beach at some point.  In the past, we have also typically taken a family vacation to Vermont the third week in July.  This summer the only thing on the schedule thus far is Boy Scout Camp for James the second week in July. Kids seem to prefer the unstructured, low-key summer to those of the past.

Somewhere between end of dinner and 8:00p.m. Family gets together for prayers.  9:00 p.m. Mairead and Rosie get ready for bed.  10:00 p.m. Girls finally settled down and go to sleep.   10:00 p.m. James gets first call for bed, which means he goes downstairs for a snack  10:00-ish Colleen goes to sleep  11:00 p.m. James get lights out call (if still awake.) Bob let's dogs out for final time and comes up for bed.  11:30 Bob goes to sleep    Jessie and Dellie are let out periodically throughout the day on an as needed basis. (They let us know when they want/need to go out.) Mostly they go out to check the yard for invading squirrels or such.  Dogs sleep most of the day just waking periodically to check out what is going on in the house.    Û¢	Jessie is our calm, happy, laid back 45 lb. All American Dog.  We got her from the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, when she was about a year.  She is now about 11 years old, but does not show any significant signs of aging.  She loves attention and is a real Daddies girl. (When Bob went to Iraq poor Jessie became very sad and melancholy, pining for her Dad. Thankfully she recovered once he returned. She loves to follow him all over the house as he does his chores on the weekends.) During the school day Jessie usually sleeps upstairs on whatever kid blankets have been left on the floor, or sometimes in the open kennel in the kitchen. Jessie mostly likes to snuggle on the floor with James at night. (Yes, James sleeps on the floor.  I think he does it now, just to get around the rule of, ""No dogs on the beds."") Even though she loves to be with James, she does make her rounds to each bedroom at some point during the night.  Jessie is what most people would die for in family dog.  She loves having her head and neck scratched, and when happy (which is most of the time) her tail wags a million miles a minute.  She also loves carrying the kidÛªs stuffed animals around the house.  She never chews on them or destroys them, just sweetly carries them around.  She also rarely barks.  In fact, she didnÛªt bark at all for the first few years, but now occasionally barks at critters in the yard.  She has also been know to hide behind trees waiting for the squirrels to come down so she can chase them off again.    Û¢	Dellie, our hefty 13 lb. Papillion, on the other hand is feistier. She affectionately goes by the nickname, fuzz-ball and suffers from the typical small dog mentality; I'm really a Great Dane in disguise. Dellie generally stays downstairs during the school day with Mom and kids or goes to her post on the stairs where she can monitor anyone passing in front of the house while still keeping an eye on the family. (Dellie has delusions of grandeur and fancies herself the great family protector.) Dellie tends to bark a little, mostly when she sees someone walking their dog down the street or when someone comes to the door.  Dellie, although not hyper, is more active than Jessie, especially in the yard.  Rosie is Dellie's favorite person. They bonded early when Dellie figured out that Rosie typically left a trail of food wherever she goes.  Dellie, although not aggressive, does not warm up to other dogs instantaneously. Even though we have had a number of ÛÏfosterÛ dogs through our house in the past few years, it still takes her a few days for her to get used to the idea of a new invader.  Once she is satisfied that the new dog knows she is top dog in the house she settles down.    Scheduled Activities:    Û¢	Monday, Tuesday and Thursday we try (emphasis on try) to reserve exclusively for schoolwork. (But would also be flexible during this time to incorporate puppy needs.)  o	James has Boy Scouts on Monday evenings from 7:00 to 8:15.  (To accommodate this, one of the kids and Colleen will drive Bob to work in the morning. We will leave about 7:15 and be back around 8:30 a.m. Then at 4:30 one of the kids and Colleen will go back and pick up Bob from work so Bob has time to have dinner before taking James to Boy Scouts.)  o	Rosie and Mairead will take a Pottery class though Fairfax County Recreation from 2:30 to 4:00 on Mondays, from March 31 through June 2, 2014. James will stay home. (Might be an opportunity here for socializing.)    Û¢	Wednesdays are our activities day and go generally as follows:  o	9:20 - Rosie, Mairead and Colleen leave for horseback riding lessons. James stays home to work on schoolwork.  o	11:20 - We swing by the house to pick up James and karate gear and head off for karate lessons.  o	2:00-ish - We swing by the house to drop off the girls and James and I head over to Fort Belvoir for his teen group meeting.  o	4:20 - James and I leave Fort Belvoir to go home.   o	(However, once or twice a month on Wednesday Bob and I go out for ""Life Counseling."" On those Wednesday's, once James and I leave Fort Belvoir, we will head to downtown D.C. to go pick up Bob from work. If it is one of the weeks to pick up Bob, we will then head home to drop-off James and then Bob and I go out. Kids fend for themselves for dinner, James takes care of the dogs and Bob and I return around 8:30.).    Û¢	On Friday's the kids and Mom attend an educational co-op with other homeschoolers at Good Shepherd Church in Mount Vernon.  We leave the house around 8:30 a.m. and return around 1:00 p.m. The spring program ends May 2, 2014 and doesnÛªt resume until fall 2014.    Û¢	Weekends are unpredictable. We do not currently have any regularly scheduled activities. So, on weekends we try to get the house cleaned up (or relatively so) and do any running around and errands that need to be done. Anything that will help reduce the strain on the weekdays. Dellie still wakes Bob up around 5:30 to go potty and check the yard, Mom still gets up around 7:00-7:30, but Bob and kids grab a few extra winks and tend to get up on their own somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00, 10:00 at the very latest. Bedtime tend to remain the same as weekdays.    Û¢	Summer is also unpredictable.  In the past we have done swim team or other activities or camps during the summer, along with a quick excursion to the beach at some point.  In the past, we have also typically taken a family vacation to Vermont the third week in July.  This summer the only thing on the schedule thus far is Boy Scout Camp for James the second week in July. Kids seem to prefer the unstructured, low-key summer to those of the past.  (BobÛªs father died over the winter and Bob used a good bit of his leave.  So we currently are unsure if we will be able to take a family vacation this summer.)    In the past I would have described our house as loud and active, but somewhere in the past year or so as the kids have gotten more into their electronics and started to headed towards their teens, both the activity level and noise level have dropped significantly.  So although Bob and I often feel like we are being pulled in several directions, overall house has slowed down.     Lastly, we have one daughter away at college.  She is 23 years old and is finishing her Bachelors in Sign Language Interpretation at Towson University in Maryland.  She has her own apartment and works full-time in addition to going to school.  Because of her busy schedule she doesnÛªt get to stop by the house as often as she would like.  Her visits tend to be two or three quick stops by the house during the week and then no visits for two or three weeks.  She is expected to graduate from Towson in the Spring of 2015 but will probably not return to the house to live after graduation.    Sorry about the length, being brief has never been my strong suit.  And you said, Û_ ÛÏleave a novel.Û"

I am a stay at home mom to two sweet girls.  Mia Nicole will be 7 yrs old in May and is currently in 1st grade.  She is my laid back, extremely kind, and sensitive child.  Ava Victoria will be 4 yrs old in May and is currently in 3 day preschool.  She is my funny, active, and out going child!  My husband has a full time job with some travel.  He is usually out of the house from 8am till 7pm most days and home weekends.  I will be the primary raiser for the puppy, but my family will help when they are home.  The family as a whole will understand all GEB trainings and concepts, so the pup on program will receive consistent and clear instruction and care.  We are an animal friendly and loving family!  We currently have 2 pugs that are very friendly and get along well with other animals.  Bailey is my fawn female and she will be turning 11 years old in September.  Taylor is my black male and he will be turning 9 in June.  They are very social and enjoy the company of other animals.  One of their favorite doggy friends is a 90 lbs lab mix named Bella.          Our typical day varies with school and activities for the girls.  During the school year, we are up and out of the house by 8:30am.  Our pugs still prefer their crate when we are not home.  Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I drive Mia to school and then drop Ava off at her preschool by 9am.  I am free from 9am to 11:30am or till 12:30am if Ava does lunch bunch.  During that time, I usually go to the gym.  When I have my GEB puppy, I plan to use that time as one-on-one training with the puppy.  In September '14, Ava will start her 4's preschool and will be going 5 days a week.  In August '15, both girls will be in elementary school full time Monday-Friday 8:30am till 3:30pm.  So, I will have even more ""free time"".  Right now, I pick Ava up from preschool at 11:30a and we go home for lunch.  We are home from noon till 3:15p most days, except for Fridays.  On Fridays, we usually get home around 2pm, bc Ava has Little Gym after preschool.  Every day Mia is in school, we leave the house around 3:15p.  If the weather is nice, we walk to school to pick up Mia.  We only live 2 blocks from Mia's school.  On Mondays, we leave around 5pm for Mia's dance class.  We return home around 7pm and my husband is usually home to greet us.  On Tuesdays, we are home all evening.  Right now, the only thing we have on Tuesdays is dropping and picking Mia up from school.  It's usually my day to do most of my laundry and bathroom cleaning.  I vacuum everyday.  I only use natural cleaning products, so no harmful chemicals around the kids or the dogs.  When cleaning my hardwood floors, I only use a steam cleaner...again, no harmful chemicals to harm the kids or dogs.  On Wednesdays, we have the same morning routine, but after picking Mia up at 3:15p, we are home for the rest of the evening and night.  On Thursdays, we drop Mia off at school and are home all day till we pick Mia up after school.  Then we go to Mia's gymnastics class from 4:30p till 6pm, then home for the night.  On Fridays, I drop both girls off at school, pick Ava up around 11:30p, lunch, Little Gym, and home by 2pm.  We pick Mia up from school and home by 4pm.  I am the classroom mom for Mia's 1st grade class and plan to continue that in the future, so I do assist and volunteer at her school from time to time.  Mia is also in girl scouts and I am the cookie mom for her troop.        Our schedule at a glance for the school year:  Mondays:  8:30a-9:00a:  Drop off both girls at school                   11:30a:  pick Ava up from preschool                    12:00p:  Lunch, errands, cleaning (usually at home for lunch)                    3:15p:  Pick Mia up from school (unless she has girl scouts (once a month),                                                      then I would pick her up at 5pm from school).                    5:00p-7:00p:  Mia's dance                    7:00p:  home for the night *girl's bedtime is 8:00pm during the week on school nights  ***except for during soccer season...she has gymnastics from 6:30p to 8:00p.

Sundays:  10a-11:15a:  Mia has formation classes at our church, but only during the school year.    Our summer schedule:  Mid-June to Mid-August is more flexible.      Our weekends can be very busy or very laid back.  It all depends on sports, birthday parties, and social events.  When the weather is nice, we are usually outside...either hiking, going to the park, lake, pool, backyard, camping, or some kind of adventure!  I am originally from NC and my husband is from MI.  So, we also travel on the weekends in the summer (usually via car).  We have a large cross over, so it can accommodate kids and dogs.  We have an annual family beach trip every summer (we drive).  Also during the summer (June-August), our schedule is more flexible as the kids are out of school and we will not have a set schedule.  The girl's will have their camps and activities, but they vary and are not as consistent as during the school year.  However, our family does love schedules and we are very organized.           During the spring and fall (April to June and September to beginning of November..usually 12 weeks or so) both girls are in soccer.  Mia has soccer practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays for an hour and games on Saturday usually lasing an hour as well.  Ava has practice on Friday evenings and a game on Saturday as well.  This is a very fun activity for the whole family and when appropriate, I think this will be great exposure, learning experience, and fun for the puppy as well!  We will be at the soccer field Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and twice on Saturday during soccer season.        We live in a 3 story single family home in the suburbs of Washington, DC.  We have a fenced in yard and live in a neighborhood.  Our neighbors are very close and we have many neighbors.  We also have many close friends that live in our neighborhood and most have dogs that we can use for socialization until our pups are fully vaccinated!  Most our friends also have fenced in yards.  We have ample side walks and many trails.  Since we do live in the suburbs, it is important to get more experience for our pup on program.  We have DC that is 30 miles away that will provide new experiences:  city, public transportation, metro, more people, more cars, busier streets, etc.  We also live near Baltimore and Annapolis.  Annapolis has more opportunities as well with the water, boats, bridges, etc.  It will be a fun day out with the whole family!      We participate in numerous charity events through the year.  The girls and I volunteer at the soup kitchen and participate in a special event near Thanksgiving for the homeless shelter every year.  I also run at least 2 half marathon races a year (usually for charity).  These activities usually occur on weekends or during the summer.      We feel blessed to be a part of such an amazing organization and be surrounded by such wonderful people!  We cannot wait to get started!"

Our weekends can be very busy or very laid back.  It all depends on sports, birthday parties, and social events.  When the weather is nice, we are usually outside...either hiking, going to the park, lake, pool, backyard, camping, or some kind of adventure!  I am originally from NC and my husband is from MI.  So, we also travel on the weekends in the summer (usually via car).  We have a large cross over, so it can accommodate kids and dogs.  We have an annual family beach trip every summer (we drive).  Also during the summer (June-August), our schedule is more flexible as the kids are out of school and we will not have a set schedule.  The girl's will have their camps and activities, but they vary and are not as consistent as during the school year.  However, our family does love schedules and we are very organized.           During the spring and fall (April to June and September to beginning of November..usually 12 weeks or so) both girls are in soccer.  Mia has soccer practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays for an hour and games on Saturday usually lasing an hour as well.  Ava has practice on Friday evenings and a game on Saturday as well.  This is a very fun activity for the whole family and when appropriate, I think this will be great exposure, learning experience, and fun for the puppy as well!  We will be at the soccer field Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and twice on Saturday during soccer season.        We live in a 3 story single family home in the suburbs of Washington, DC.  We have a fenced in yard and live in a neighborhood.  Our neighbors are very close and we have many neighbors.  We also have many close friends that live in our neighborhood and most have dogs that we can use for socialization until our pups are fully vaccinated!  Most our friends also have fenced in yards.  We have ample side walks and many trails.  Since we do live in the suburbs, it is important to get more experience for our pup on program.  We have DC that is 30 miles away that will provide new experiences:  city, public transportation, metro, more people, more cars, busier streets, etc.  We also live near Baltimore and Annapolis.  Annapolis has more opportunities as well with the water, boats, bridges, etc.  It will be a fun day out with the whole family!      We participate in numerous charity events through the year.  The girls and I volunteer at the soup kitchen and participate in a special event near Thanksgiving for the homeless shelter every year.  I also run at least 2 half marathon races a year (usually for charity).  These activities usually occur on weekends or during the summer.

I am a stay at home mom to two sweet girls.  Mia Nicole will be 7 yrs old in May and is currently in 1st grade.  She is my laid back, extremely kind, and sensitive child.  Ava Victoria will be 4 yrs old in May and is currently in 3 day preschool.  She is my funny, active, and out going child!  My husband has a full time job with some travel.  He is usually out of the house from 8am till 7pm most days and home weekends.  I will be the primary raiser for the puppy, but my family will help when they are home.  The family as a whole will understand all GEB trainings and concepts, so the pup on program will receive consistent and clear instruction and care.  We are an animal friendly and loving family!  We currently have 2 pugs that are very friendly and get along well with other animals.  Bailey is my fawn female and she will be turning 11 years old in September.  Taylor is my black male and he will be turning 9 in June.  They are very social and enjoy the company of other animals.  One of their favorite doggy friends is a 90 lbs lab mix named Bella.          Our typical day varies with school and activities for the girls.  During the school year, we are up and out of the house by 8:30am.  Our pugs still prefer their crate when we are not home.  Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I drive Mia to school and then drop Ava off at her preschool by 9am.  I am free from 9am to 11:30am or till 12:30am if Ava does lunch bunch.  During that time, I usually go to the gym.  When I have my GEB puppy, I plan to use that time as one-on-one training with the puppy.  In September '14, Ava will start her 4's preschool and will be going 5 days a week.  In August '15, both girls will be in elementary school full time Monday-Friday 8:30am till 3:30pm.  So, I will have even more ""free time"".  Right now, I pick Ava up from preschool at 11:30a and we go home for lunch.  We are home from noon till 3:15p most days, except for Fridays.  On Fridays, we usually get home around 2pm, bc Ava has Little Gym after preschool.  Every day Mia is in school, we leave the house around 3:15p.  If the weather is nice, we walk to school to pick up Mia.  We only live 2 blocks from Mia's school.  On Mondays, we leave around 5pm for Mia's dance class.  We return home around 7pm and my husband is usually home to greet us.  On Tuesdays, we are home all evening.  Right now, the only thing we have on Tuesdays is dropping and picking Mia up from school.  It's usually my day to do most of my laundry and bathroom cleaning.  I vacuum everyday.  I only use natural cleaning products, so no harmful chemicals around the kids or the dogs.  When cleaning my hardwood floors, I only use a steam cleaner...again, no harmful chemicals to harm the kids or dogs.  On Wednesdays, we have the same morning routine, but after picking Mia up at 3:15p, we are home for the rest of the evening and night.  On Thursdays, we drop Mia off at school and are home all day till we pick Mia up after school.  Then we go to Mia's gymnastics class from 4:30p till 6pm, then home for the night.  On Fridays, I drop both girls off at school, pick Ava up around 11:30p, lunch, Little Gym, and home by 2pm.  We pick Mia up from school and home by 4pm.  I am the classroom mom for Mia's 1st grade class and plan to continue that in the future, so I do assist and volunteer at her school from time to time.  Mia is also in girl scouts and I am the cookie mom for her troop.

Ava Victoria will be 4 yrs old in May and is currently in 3 day preschool.  She is my funny, active, and out going child!  My husband has a full time job with some travel.  He is usually out of the house from 8am till 7pm most days and home weekends.  I will be the primary raiser for the puppy, but my family will help when they are home.  The family as a whole will understand all GEB trainings and concepts, so the pup on program will receive consistent and clear instruction and care.  We are an animal friendly and loving family!  We currently have 2 pugs that are very friendly and get along well with other animals.  Bailey is my fawn female and she will be turning 11 years old in September.

Our typical day varies with school and activities for the girls.  During the school year, we are up and out of the house by 8:30am.  Our pugs still prefer their crate when we are not home.  Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I drive Mia to school and then drop Ava off at her preschool by 9am.  I am free from 9am to 11:30am or till 12:30am if Ava does lunch bunch.  During that time, I usually go to the gym.  When I have my GEB puppy, I plan to use that time as one-on-one training with the puppy.  In September '14, Ava will start her 4's preschool and will be going 5 days a week.  In August '15, both girls will be in elementary school full time Monday-Friday 8:30am till 3:30pm.  So, I will have even more ""free time"".  Right now, I pick Ava up from preschool at 11:30a and we go home for lunch.  We are home from noon till 3:15p most days, except for Fridays.  On Fridays, we usually get home around 2pm, bc Ava has Little Gym after preschool.  Every day Mia is in school, we leave the house around 3:15p.  If the weather is nice, we walk to school to pick up Mia.  We only live 2 blocks from Mia's school.  On Mondays, we leave around 5pm for Mia's dance class.  We return home around 7pm and my husband is usually home to greet us.  On Tuesdays, we are home all evening.  Right now, the only thing we have on Tuesdays is dropping and picking Mia up from school.  It's usually my day to do most of my laundry and bathroom cleaning.  I vacuum everyday.  I only use natural cleaning products, so no harmful chemicals around the kids or the dogs.  When cleaning my hardwood floors, I only use a steam cleaner...again, no harmful chemicals to harm the kids or dogs.  On Wednesdays, we have the same morning routine, but after picking Mia up at 3:15p, we are home for the rest of the evening and night.  On Thursdays, we drop Mia off at school and are home all day till we pick Mia up after school.  Then we go to Mia's gymnastics class from 4:30p till 6pm, then home for the night.

Sundays:  10a-11:15a:  Mia has formation classes at our church, but only during the school year.    Our summer schedule:  Mid-June to Mid-August is more flexible.      Our weekends can be very busy or very laid back.  It all depends on sports, birthday parties, and social events.  When the weather is nice, we are usually outside...either hiking, going to the park, lake, pool, backyard, camping, or some kind of adventure!  I am originally from NC and my husband is from MI.  So, we also travel on the weekends in the summer (usually via car).  We have a large cross over, so it can accommodate kids and dogs.  We have an annual family beach trip every summer (we drive).  Also during the summer (June-August), our schedule is more flexible as the kids are out of school and we will not have a set schedule.  The girl's will have their camps and activities, but they vary and are not as consistent as during the school year.  However, our family does love schedules and we are very organized.           During the spring and fall (April to June and September to beginning of November..usually 12 weeks or so) both girls are in soccer.  Mia has soccer practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays for an hour and games on Saturday usually lasing an hour as well.  Ava has practice on Friday evenings and a game on Saturday as well.  This is a very fun activity for the whole family and when appropriate, I think this will be great exposure, learning experience, and fun for the puppy as well!  We will be at the soccer field Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and twice on Saturday during soccer season.        We live in a 3 story single family home in the suburbs of Washington, DC.  We have a fenced in yard and live in a neighborhood.  Our neighbors are very close and we have many neighbors.  We also have many close friends that live in our neighborhood and most have dogs that we can use for socialization until our pups are fully vaccinated!  Most our friends also have fenced in yards.  We have ample side walks and many trails.  Since we do live in the suburbs, it is important to get more experience for our pup on program.  We have DC that is 30 miles away that will provide new experiences:  city, public transportation, metro, more people, more cars, busier streets, etc.  We also live near Baltimore and Annapolis.  Annapolis has more opportunities as well with the water, boats, bridges, etc.  It will be a fun day out with the whole family!      We participate in numerous charity events through the year.  The girls and I volunteer at the soup kitchen and participate in a special event near Thanksgiving for the homeless shelter every year.  I also run at least 2 half marathon races a year (usually for charity).  These activities usually occur on weekends or during the summer.      We feel blessed to be a part of such an amazing organization and be surrounded by such wonderful people!  We cannot wait to get started!"

Sundays:  10a-11:15a:  Mia has formation classes at our church, but only during the school year.    Our summer schedule:  Mid-June to Mid-August is more flexible.      Our weekends can be very busy or very laid back.  It all depends on sports, birthday parties, and social events.  When the weather is nice, we are usually outside...either hiking, going to the park, lake, pool, backyard, camping, or some kind of adventure!  I am originally from NC and my husband is from MI.  So, we also travel on the weekends in the summer (usually via car).  We have a large cross over, so it can accommodate kids and dogs.  We have an annual family beach trip every summer (we drive).  Also during the summer (June-August), our schedule is more flexible as the kids are out of school and we will not have a set schedule.  The girl's will have their camps and activities, but they vary and are not as consistent as during the school year.  However, our family does love schedules and we are very organized.           During the spring and fall (April to June and September to beginning of November..usually 12 weeks or so) both girls are in soccer.  Mia has soccer practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays for an hour and games on Saturday usually lasing an hour as well.  Ava has practice on Friday evenings and a game on Saturday as well.  This is a very fun activity for the whole family and when appropriate, I think this will be great exposure, learning experience, and fun for the puppy as well!  We will be at the soccer field Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and twice on Saturday during soccer season.        We live in a 3 story single family home in the suburbs of Washington, DC.  We have a fenced in yard and live in a neighborhood.  Our neighbors are very close and we have many neighbors.  We also have many close friends that live in our neighborhood and most have dogs that we can use for socialization until our pups are fully vaccinated!  Most our friends also have fenced in yards.  We have ample side walks and many trails.  Since we do live in the suburbs, it is important to get more experience for our pup on program.  We have DC that is 30 miles away that will provide new experiences:  city, public transportation, metro, more people, more cars, busier streets, etc.  We also live near Baltimore and Annapolis.  Annapolis has more opportunities as well with the water, boats, bridges, etc.  It will be a fun day out with the whole family!      We participate in numerous charity events through the year.  The girls and I volunteer at the soup kitchen and participate in a special event near Thanksgiving for the homeless shelter every year.  I also run at least 2 half marathon races a year (usually for charity).  These activities usually occur on weekends or during the summer.      We feel blessed to be a part of such an amazing organization and be surrounded by such wonderful people!  We cannot wait to get started!"

I am a stay at home mom to two sweet girls.  Mia Nicole will be 7 yrs old in May and is currently in 1st grade.  She is my laid back, extremely kind, and sensitive child.  Ava Victoria will be 4 yrs old in May and is currently in 3 day preschool.  She is my funny, active, and out going child!  My husband has a full time job with some travel.  He is usually out of the house from 8am till 7pm most days and home weekends.  I will be the primary raiser for the puppy, but my family will help when they are home.  The family as a whole will understand all GEB trainings and concepts, so the pup on program will receive consistent and clear instruction and care.  We are an animal friendly and loving family!  We currently have 2 pugs that are very friendly and get along well with other animals.  Bailey is my fawn female and she will be turning 11 years old in September.  Taylor is my black male and he will be turning 9 in June.  They are very social and enjoy the company of other animals.  One of their favorite doggy friends is a 90 lbs lab mix named Bella.          Our typical day varies with school and activities for the girls.  During the school year, we are up and out of the house by 8:30am.  Our pugs still prefer their crate when we are not home.  Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I drive Mia to school and then drop Ava off at her preschool by 9am.  I am free from 9am to 11:30am or till 12:30am if Ava does lunch bunch.  During that time, I usually go to the gym.  When I have my GEB puppy, I plan to use that time as one-on-one training with the puppy.  In September '14, Ava will start her 4's preschool and will be going 5 days a week.  In August '15, both girls will be in elementary school full time Monday-Friday 8:30am till 3:30pm.  So, I will have even more ""free time"".  Right now, I pick Ava up from preschool at 11:30a and we go home for lunch.  We are home from noon till 3:15p most days, except for Fridays.  On Fridays, we usually get home around 2pm, bc Ava has Little Gym after preschool.  Every day Mia is in school, we leave the house around 3:15p.  If the weather is nice, we walk to school to pick up Mia.  We only live 2 blocks from Mia's school.  On Mondays, we leave around 5pm for Mia's dance class.  We return home around 7pm and my husband is usually home to greet us.  On Tuesdays, we are home all evening.  Right now, the only thing we have on Tuesdays is dropping and picking Mia up from school.  It's usually my day to do most of my laundry and bathroom cleaning.  I vacuum everyday.  I only use natural cleaning products, so no harmful chemicals around the kids or the dogs.  When cleaning my hardwood floors, I only use a steam cleaner...again, no harmful chemicals to harm the kids or dogs.  On Wednesdays, we have the same morning routine, but after picking Mia up at 3:15p, we are home for the rest of the evening and night.  On Thursdays, we drop Mia off at school and are home all day till we pick Mia up after school.  Then we go to Mia's gymnastics class from 4:30p till 6pm, then home for the night.  On Fridays, I drop both girls off at school, pick Ava up around 11:30p, lunch, Little Gym, and home by 2pm.  We pick Mia up from school and home by 4pm.  I am the classroom mom for Mia's 1st grade class and plan to continue that in the future, so I do assist and volunteer at her school from time to time.  Mia is also in girl scouts and I am the cookie mom for her troop.        Our schedule at a glance for the school year:  Mondays:  8:30a-9:00a:  Drop off both girls at school                   11:30a:  pick Ava up from preschool                    12:00p:  Lunch, errands, cleaning (usually at home for lunch)                    3:15p:  Pick Mia up from school (unless she has girl scouts (once a month),                                                      then I would pick her up at 5pm from school).                    5:00p-7:00p:  Mia's dance                    7:00p:  home for the night *girl's bedtime is 8:00pm during the week on school nights  ***except for during soccer season...she has gymnastics from 6:30p to 8:00p.

I participate in softball during the spring for school, and play for a tournament team during the summer.  Any time that I am not in school is considered flexible and after school practices.  However, my sister has agreed to take the puppy out to eliminate, feed the puppy, and have play time.  All the members of my family have agreed to helping to raise the puppy, but I will be the leader.  I am planning on waking up early to take care of the puppy, to go on walks before I get ready.  I understand that some mornings it may be hard, but the puppy's needs will come before mine, even if that means not doing my hair that day.  I have another dog in my house, named Buddy, which I think will be a great role model towards the puppy.  Also, I have two cats, which will give the puppy another opportunity to socialize with other animals.

Karim & I will probably be splitting our puppy raising responsibilities in half due to our schedules and the fact that it is just the two of us, no other family members. We live in a one-floor/one-bedroom hours (no upstairs/downstairs) in a pretty rural part of Watertown (we can't even get internet connection at the house) that is bordered by a summer camp and a horse farm.  The house has about a 1/4 mile long driveway...so there is lots of room outside!  We are both very active and do a lot of biking & running, so we are used to having to go outside in all kinds of weather.  Karim works at UConn (there will be some awesome socialization options on campus at some point!) and I work at the YMCA (about 10 minutes from home, so not far). Monday-Thursday I will typically be the one to get up in the morning with the puppy, before work, and then Karim will be home with him most days until noonish, and in the afternoon I will be home, or be able to take a break and come home for a while to let the puppy out.

We'd go to a friend's fenced-in backyard 2x/week and Secret would run w/Manny and 2 other dogs. We would play catch in our backyard on the long leashseveral times/week(now it's t","We have raised 2 GEB puppies before: Yani, who came to us in July2007 and had her graduation Aug 15, 2009. We also raised Manny who passed his IFT but was released while in training. We adopted him on 11/10/2011. He will be 4 yrs old in June. He is now a therapy dog and I will be taking him to regular visits that are usually no longer than 1 hour.   I work part time (usually 1 day/week) at ""Central Hospital for Veterinary Medicine"" (4 Devine St, North Haven, CT 06473) as a Tech Assistant. I have spoken with my supervisor and she said I could put a crate in the Dr's office where there is no contact with sick patients, although there might be occasionally a Dr's pet in that room. I will request not to take care of contagious patients while the puppy is at work with me. I always change out of my scrubs before coming home after work. I just found out that another puppy raiser from our region is interested in puppysitting our new pup on the days I'll be working! So I won't need to bring the pup to work after all! When the puppy is old enough to stay in the crate for several hours, I will leave the puppy home and my husband will take the puppy and Manny out once while I'm at work (he already does this for Manny now).   I volunteer at the Middle School Library 2 mornings/ week and at the Food Pantry on Sat mornings and babysit for our church's Moms' group one morning/week. I am also very involved with my church and participate in several weekly groups. I will put any of my activities on hold until the puppy is able to be in the crate for longer periods or as the puppy gets used to new exposures, I hope to include the pup in my activities with me.   We live in a house with a fairly large back yard which is not fenced in. We let Manny out on a long (50ft) leash and play with him there.   Manny and I walk to a friend's house (where there is a fenced-in back yard) several mornings/ week and another friend and her dog join us there too. The 3 dogs play for a while then Manny and I walk home;It's about 1 mile each way. I am hoping to bring the new pup with us on these outings. Of course he/she won't be able to walk the mile each way at the beginning, so we'll need to drive. Bur as the pup gets older I'm hoping to do this.   Our neighborhood is quiet, but there are quite busy streets very close by. My husband and Manny and I like to  take long walks every day and part of the walk is along the busy street, so Manny is very used to traffic. We would be including the new pup on the walks as he/she is able.   Our older son will be getting married out of State in June, so we will be needing a puppysitter for a few weeks then.  We usually drive out to Chicago once or twice/ year to visit family. We have in the past brought the GEB pups we were raising with us on these trips and hope to do this again with the new pup.  Manny loves other dogs and is very gentle and submissive. He would be a great ""big brother"" to a little pup, I think. Hopefully he will only teach his good manners :)!"

One of us is home most of the time and would never leave the puppy for more than 3 hours in a crate, and that would be very unusual.  We have 9 very active grandkids (ages 13 - 5), all of whom live nearby and are at our house a lot, especially in the summer when they are swimming most of the day in our backyard pool.      We have 2 labs (both from Guiding Eyes released pups). Chelsea is almost 13 but very active and in excellent health, though she probably won't  pay a lot of attention to the pup. Daisy is nearly 8 and will want to play with the pup but will leave the pup alone and both will take naps often.  We sometimes have other dogs (a paramedic friend whose dog is with us about one day a week and has been for several years, and our grandkids dogs occasionally). All but one are female, and the male is neutered but he is unlikely to come over anyway.    We have a large, fenced in yard and a swimming pool in the center of it. Our 2 dogs have free run of the yard, which has gardens around the perimeter. We have an electric fence, but it is not turned on since both of our dogs are already trained on it and never leave the area - we have it to train them to stay out of most of the gardens, but we are pretty flexible with that.  Neither Daisy or Chelsea swim, but other dogs do, especially when the kids are in the pool - how about the Pup on this?    Our day usually starts early - about 6 a.m. when I will get up and let the dogs out, then feed them and let them out again - we will take the pup on a leash for this, of course, but our dogs will just go out by themselves - they know where in the  yard they are to go to poop and pee.  We will take the pup to the same area.  Then I go to 7 a.m.  Mass, then to the Y until about 10 a.m.  I would crate the pup at 7 am.  Scott gets up about 8 a.m and will play/train the puppy.  He is likely to be home until noon, when I will be home - then he goes to the Y. He comes home about 3 p.m., then I am likely to be out until dinner time, when we are both home for the evening. Occasionally we go out to dinner.  On weekends, our schedule is more hectic/varied - often around attending various sports events for the kids (can we take the pup with us to a soccer game for example - on leash, of course?)    On Tuesdays, I am gone all day - from 5:30 a.m. (so dogs get up early on 'Tuesday) until about 9 p.m. - am an EMT with the New Canaan Volunteer Ambulance. Scott is almost always home, but on the occasion he is not, one of my fellow EMT's (who will be very familiar with the program) will come care for the dogs.    Daisy and Chelsea do not jump on counters, go on beds or furniture, or chew on stuff.  We will have toys, etc for the pup and a crate in our kitchen/family room.  Daisy and Chelsea are not crated anymore.      In the near future - Scott will be gone for a week in early April, but I will have an EMT friend help my on the Tuesday he is gone. We have an annual Easter party and egg hunt on Easter (about 150 people, a lot of them kids) and the pup will need to be crated upstairs in a bedroom for about 4 hours during the party - that will be on April 20).  And we hare having a big weekend family reunion here at the end of July - shouldn't really interfere with training, but life will be a bit more hectic that weekend. Other than that - no big plans for anything else.  How do you feel about these things and the training?    We very much want to do this and have a successful pup that will go on to be a happy Guide Dog.  As we talked about on the phone, our biggest concerns are the many kids who will be here often (though all will know the ""rules"" and have dogs and are very excited about this, but kids are kids), the yard and our un-leashed dogs, and the pool.

Jessie and I have also arranged daily play dates to ensure the puppy will get the proper amount of physical and mental stimulation. My school's guidelines (Medaille College) is that the puppy must be 12 weeks of age and fully vaccinated before he can be on campus. Taking this into consideration, I would like to discuss the possibility of getting an older puppy (12 weeks of age) to expedite my raising experience. Thank you for this opportunity and I look forward to meeting my puppy."

My typical class schedule is 4 or less classes a day which amount to 1 to 6 hours of class with varying amounts of breaks depending on the day. I live on campus in a dorm room with a roommate. Each dorm floor has about 30 rooms with 5 floors in the building. During the school week (Monday-Friday) I do not work at a secondary job, my primary job is school work.  A puppy who is more quiet is preferable. On the weekends (Saturday-Sunday) I work at a dollar store away from school which entails me to stay at my house (Orchard Park) for those days and off campus. On average I can work from 4-6 hours on those days. Though I will be away from the puppy for those times, my mother, who has been taking the pre-placement classes with me, does not work and is home all weekend. I have been at the dollar store for 3+ years and usually have no problem working around my schedule for any reason. I do own 2 other older dogs at my house. The eldest is a 5 year old Coonhound. Though she is older, she can keep up with a little pup! The other is a 2 year old Cocker Spaniel/Pug mix who is a ball full of energy any time of day!

We live in a suburban single-family two-story home with a fenced in backyard and a nice park across the street.    Typically it's a push to get everyone out by 7:45am to schools and work. Mom stays at home but has enjoyed some free-lance work predominately in her home office. School is dismissed at 3, so the kids return by 3:30, but different days have different kids home at different times depending on the sports season. Basically count on 2:30-8pm being a carpool extracurricular extravaganza with some kids left at home to mind supper and do homework. It is a rare night that anyone but Dad is out after 8. Dad works hard, and often late.    Julianna, 15, is a ballerina with classes T & Th 5-7pm at the school at the end of our street. She is also active in her school's theater department so in the spring there will be one ""Tech-Week"" where all hands are on deck and we don't see her until 10pm. She is a serious student who really looks forward to a companion to be with her and her laptop during those long study sessions.    Katie, 13, had knee surgery this fall. She no longer needs a brace and can bend her knee. She will use crutches for only one to two more weeks.  She has physical therapy on T/Th for 1 hour, but the doctor has told her no sports this spring. He has given her the green light to get a puppy -- as long as it's not a ""big"" puppy. Already, the whole prospect of raising a puppy has brightened her outlook tremendously. She can walk the dog on sidewalks, but won't be doing any off-roading in the woods of our neighborhood park anytime soon.    Lauren, 11, is over scheduled -- especially in the winter months.  She does year round swimming with practices 5-6pm M & W; is on the school basketball team with practices on Th nights 5:30-6:30 and games on Sunday afternoons and a few Sat nights; and is also on the White Tail Ski Team which involves one parent driving her up and back on both Saturdays and Sundays. We leave at 7am and get back around 3pm.  Some weekends we don't go both days -- especially if it is raining and too warm. The other girls don't participate in this, so they will be home during this time. Even though Lauren is the busiest schedule-wise, she is the youngest, most affectionate, and most playful.  I have witnessed her taking the neighbor's dogs out for walks in the rain, and I know she will be loyal beyond belief to this dog. She doesn't realize this, but she really does need to be older than somebody (anybody!) else in the house. This is her opportunity to be a big sister, and I know she can't wait.    My daughters are all very excited about doing this. They were raised to be social-minded and believe in giving back. They just didn't realize it could be so much fun! I think there will be some over-zealousness in the beginning, but given the realities of our hectic schedules, things will settle down. They are going to cover each other when needed and divvy up the chores and pleasures of having a pet in a chart so that they can share the responsibilities and the love.    Upon further reflection, we think we would prefer to have a female dog -- after all we do specialize in girls!  As you know, our previous GEB dog was a Golden, so a GLAB would be welcome as much as a Lab. We know all about the hair getting EVERYWHERE, so with that in mind, yellow is our preference but not an absolute requirement. (Vacuuming is going to be an item on that chore chart!)    Re:vacations - we take two weeks off in the summer typically in August. One with each set of Grand Parents. Often, we do vacation rental by owner, and there is a possibility of getting a dog-friendly house if it is ok with GEB to bring the puppy with us to the beach/mountains in NC or maybe even the Eastern Shore. We are happy to host other dogs for puppy swaps as well as when other raisers have trips planned.      Since the high school schedule does not match the elementary school schedule, we will not be going away for spring break.  Instead there is a 4-day weekend in Feb for President's Day, and Daddy is in dire need of a vacation with his family.  Nothing is set in stone yet, but we would like to raise a flag that we are likely to need coverage for that time.    I am really looking forward to being a part of the GEB community again. Things have changed quite a bit, so the girls will be on top of me as to what the current methods are and correct my old habits. Already I have enjoyed watching my daughters take this responsibility with such seriousness and vigor. They spur each other on to do the readings, to puppy-proof not only their rooms but the whole house, and to campaign their Dad into getting the puppy in January instead of ""who-knows-when!"" later in the year.  It has been heart warming, and the dog isn't even here yet! Thank you for giving the Longs such happiness already."

As you know, our previous GEB dog was a Golden, so a GLAB would be welcome as much as a Lab. We know all about the hair getting EVERYWHERE, so with that in mind, yellow is our preference but not an absolute requirement. (Vacuuming is going to be an item on that chore chart!)    Re:vacations - we take two weeks off in the summer typically in August. One with each set of Grand Parents. Often, we do vacation rental by owner, and there is a possibility of getting a dog-friendly house if it is ok with GEB to bring the puppy with us to the beach/mountains in NC or maybe even the Eastern Shore. We are happy to host other dogs for puppy swaps as well as when other raisers have trips planned.      Since the high school schedule does not match the elementary school schedule, we will not be going away for spring break.  Instead there is a 4-day weekend in Feb for President's Day, and Daddy is in dire need of a vacation with his family.  Nothing is set in stone yet, but we would like to raise a flag that we are likely to need coverage for that time.    I am really looking forward to being a part of the GEB community again. Things have changed quite a bit, so the girls will be on top of me as to what the current methods are and correct my old habits. Already I have enjoyed watching my daughters take this responsibility with such seriousness and vigor. They spur each other on to do the readings, to puppy-proof not only their rooms but the whole house, and to campaign their Dad into getting the puppy in January instead of ""who-knows-when!"" later in the year.  It has been heart warming, and the dog isn't even here yet! Thank you for giving the Longs such happiness already."

I do, once a week, occasionally more, occasionally less work at CT US&R headquarters in Hartford.  We have US&R dogs on our team.  Also some of the State Troopers have offices in the building and they have GEB trained dogs. The puppy will be warmly welcomed at the office.  I have a large, secure indoor train/play space available for the puppy and me.  Also a crate will be on site next to my desk for the puppy.  During the week we live in a condo with safe, quiet streets.  We live in a ""cluster"" with neighbors very close.  We have a golden retriever and maltese adult dogs in the cluster, and many dogs in the condo complex. We also have a fenced in tennis court where the puppy and I can train/play (after the snow melts).  On the weekends we live in a house with stairs.  The dead end road is quiet and we have woods with trails next to the property.  This switching of residences will end in mid-June when we will permanently leave the condo.

His office hours are 10 am-6 pm. His weekend schedule is flexible.  The puppy is welcome to be with Mitch at the office.  The company is very understanding and supportive and will allow Mitch the time he needs to tend to the puppy's needs.    Kyle-High School senior.  Has the least flexible schedule.  Kyle attends high school from 7:10 am -2:05 pm.  He works after school at IBM until 5 pm-ish.  If, need be, Kyle can be home with the puppy after school until 3 pm. Kyle is also taking a 4 hour college course on Tuesday nights which unfortunately is a direct conflict with the GEB class.  On Tuesdays, Kyle does not work and is home from 2:30 pm to 5:00 pm.  In August Kyle will be leaving to attend Syracuse University."

So, right now my schedule is completely flexible.  Any work I sign up for next year will allow for flexibility as a requirement.  My husband works at home the majority of the time, with office trips 0 - 4 days a week.   Mostly--he is home.  So, if I leave for a while, the pup has someone to say with.  Pup won't be left alone at all until she/he feels safe in a crate.  We have two dogs--one sluggly golden and one high-energy shepherd is loves to teach and play with puppies!  She is so good at teaching them--it is adorable to watch!  Course--she tries to teach them undesirable things as well, sometimes, so we watch her instructions constantly!  We walk our dogs 4 miles a day, so will incorporate that into the puppies routine when pup is able.  We have a large fenced in yard (6 ft vinyl), so there is lots of opportunity for play time and exercise.  Plus--I need to get out of the house!  So, the pup will be going everywhere!

Others I stay at school or run errands until around 11:00  home until 3:15  back with kids at 4:30  2 evenings a week they have activities for about an hour   dinner, home work, play for a bit, baths & bed  8:30 making lunches for next day  down time until I go to bed around 10    Typical weekend  wake up around 7:30  Saturday morning kid activities from 9:00-11:00  the rest of the weekend varies depending on the time of year.  Maybe a hike or bike rides, maybe visit with friends or family. (A lot of these things the pup could come too) maybe a weekend movie night.  Sunday is often a lazy-ish morning with chores in the afternoon.    We have a 2 story home with a large yard (2 acres) it is not fenced in though.  There are walking trails that run along the property and continue for miles into neighboring towns.    From mid-January to mid-April my husbands work schedule keeps him so busy that he's not around much.  I don't know how disruptive this would be for a puppy that was used to 5 of us, to go to 4 in the house regularly.  Then back to 5 until the following January.  We do travel in the summer, usually a week or 2, & a few camping trips.  We have a trailer & the camp grounds we stay at are dog friendly, I'd like to bring the pup with us.

Others I stay at school or run errands until around 11:00  home until 3:15  back with kids at 4:30  2 evenings a week they have activities for about an hour   dinner, home work, play for a bit, baths & bed  8:30 making lunches for next day  down time until I go to bed around 10    Typical weekend  wake up around 7:30  Saturday morning kid activities from 9:00-11:00  the rest of the weekend varies depending on the time of year.  Maybe a hike or bike rides, maybe visit with friends or family. (A lot of these things the pup could come too) maybe a weekend movie night.  Sunday is often a lazy-ish morning with chores in the afternoon.    We have a 2 story home with a large yard (2 acres) it is not fenced in though.  There are walking trails that run along the property and continue for miles into neighboring towns.    From mid-January to mid-April my husbands work schedule keeps him so busy that he's not around much.  I don't know how disruptive this would be for a puppy that was used to 5 of us, to go to 4 in the house regularly.  Then back to 5 until the following January.  We do travel in the summer, usually a week or 2, & a few camping trips.  We have a trailer & the camp grounds we stay at are dog friendly, I'd like to bring the pup with us.  I do take to the kids away for spring break, I don't know if I would be able to bring a dog on that trip.

Primary training responsibilities fall to Jeffrey; however, April is available especially in the early months to assist during the day while Jeffrey is in school (6:30-2:30).  April works part time and can arrange her schedule to be gone at most 4 hours during the day, many days she is either available all day or only out for 2-3 hours.  We have a large (coon hound mix) dog, 4 years old, who is quite energetic. Our first concern is how she will react to the puppy.  She has never been aggressive but can be excitable and needs a lot of activity during the day.  The household also has a 7 year old boy who, while energetic, is fairly calm and used to being around dogs.  He occasionally has friends visit which could create temporary chaos.  Weekends are flexible and usually involve multiple people who can be around.  We usually travel for several days around Christmas to an environment where a puppy would not be welcome so we would need help then.  We also have a summer vacation of a week (but obviously no need to worry about that until next year now)."

I make coffee and then send Jackie off to school around 620. I feed our dog Cody and also let him out into our fenced yard to Get Busy! I then go for a walk or sometimes have coffee first and then go for a walk for about 1 hour.  Following that I usually read the paer and watch the news, a luxuary  of being retired.  At about 830-900 I usually get ready for the day's projects and get showered and dressed.  During any day I may work in the garden or do some kind of project around the house until about noon.  I break for lunch and then finish up whatever I was working on during the morning.  If I didn't get a walk in the morning done, I sometimes will go in the afternoon or evening.  Usually around 300 there is some sort of after school activity to be attending or driving to such as soccer games, skiing or concerts.  Then we head home for dinner and homework.

During a typical day during the school year, I am usually up at 530 and come downstairs to fix lunches and breakfast for Jackie. (Katie will be away at college).  I make coffee and then send Jackie off to school around 620. I feed our dog Cody and also let him out into our fenced yard to Get Busy! I then go for a walk or sometimes have coffee first and then go for a walk for about 1 hour.  Following that I usually read the paer and watch the news, a luxuary  of being retired.  At about 830-900 I usually get ready for the day's projects and get showered and dressed.  During any day I may work in the garden or do some kind of project around the house until about noon.  I break for lunch and then finish up whatever I was working on during the morning.  If I didn't get a walk in the morning done, I sometimes will go in the afternoon or evening.  Usually around 300 there is some sort of after school activity to be attending or driving to such as soccer games, skiing or concerts.  Then we head home for dinner and homework.  If time relax and then Jackie goes to bed around 10 and I follow around 11.  I also do volunteer work at our local food pantry but that schedule is flexible and varies through the month.  I am usually up around 630 ish and then read the paper and have coffee and plan for the events of the day.Weekends are usually driven by teen schedules of socialization and or shopping.  Being retired my days are flexible though I do follow the school schedule since Jackie is still in HS.  As I mentioned we do have another small dog, Cody who is a neutered male bishon frese mix.  He is 5 1/2 years old.  Was a rescue dog and loves other dogs much more than people.  He is very timid around other pepole.  We live in a rural neighborhood village and are walking distance to the school yard as well as state wet lands (bashakill)  Our home is two stories and we have a fenced in backyard.  As Katie is away at college in Vermont we do sometimes go and visit although it is usually for a weekend or short period of time.  We also do vacation during the year  for a couple of weeks although nothing is planned at this point.  Other than the unexpected occurances in the life of teenagers, I have a pretty flexible schedule with my time.  I hope this helps and feel free to ask for any other information that would be helpful."

Ryan works varied hours as well and will be attending college in the fall.  We also have a collie, Whitney, who is 9 years old. She has a very calm temperament and has always been very good with other dogs. She even has been a licensed therapy dog through Therapy Dogs International. We think she will do very well with a pup and prefer that we get a male pup ( a yellow lab would be great if that worked out as a good match) to help eliminate multiple female issues. Oh, and yes, Whitney is spayed.  During the summer, when the pup will arrive, I will be working 3 days during the week, and Karissa will be home during the day to help with training of the pup. Ryan will be in and out at varied times and will be helpful as well. Tom works in Hartford daily and will be available to help with training, especially house manners. :)  We live in a rural neighborhood, our back yard is fenced in, we have a one-level ranch home so out to ""get busy"" will be easy (as easy as it can be with a young pup! but will improve as the pup grows). We have a good area to walk around the neighborhood (tho' no sidewalks in our immediate neighborhood). We are active people and will be able to give the pup lots of exercise and exposure to lots of experiences. we can bring the pup to the beach walk, walking trails, shopping areas, work, the hospital, all in time as the pup develops and is ready for these experiences.  by the time school starts, we still would not need to have the pup in the crate more than 5 hours maximum since we are all staggered in when we arrive home.

We're a fairly quiet family and our current dog is a gentle soul, so we're not one of those constant motion, tons of noise and activity families ... tho we sometimes wish we were!  We will be privileged to help Guiding Eyes provide a guide dog to someone who needs one."

I go home everyday during my lunch hour, which is from 12-1. During that time I am usually home for about 40 minutes. I then return from work for the evening at about 5:10. I do have dog training classes at Petco Tuesday and/or Thursday nights (depending on whether or not anyone has signed up for the class). The class isn't until 7 so I would have enough time to exercise and interact with the pup after my day job before teaching the class. I am also able to bring the pup to my classes with me, as long as that would be okay with Guiding Eyes. This would depend on the individual class (whether it was a big or small class, and the dogs in it) and it would depend on the comfort level of the pup.  I understand the importance of not putting pressure on the pup to enter situations they are not yet comfortable with and I also understand the need to be able to pay close attention to the pup so I know when they are moving out of the Think and Learn zone. The class is only an hour long so I am usually home by 8:15. I go to bed anywhere between 9:00 and 10:00.   On nights that I do not have to work I like to keep busy and like to be outside. I often go to local parks to take my dog for a walk or I have a couple friends who live downtown whose houses I will park at and they will join me for a walk. My mom sometimes joins me on these walks too, which would give me the option of bringing my dog along with the pup if I wanted. My dog is getting older and tires more easily so I do foresee leaving her home many nights, especially because its important to have lots of one on one time with the pup.   My weekends are very similar to my free week nights. I do hold a 1 hour seminar every other Sunday at Petco, but other than that my schedule is open. I live out in the country and my family owns a lot of property so I like to be outside doing things around the yard, walking the trails, or go for walks in the city and take advantage of the different events going on.    My mom has offered to help out with the pup as much as possible and my brother is also currently available during the day to help out. They both live two houses down from me (there's actually a trail through fields and woods our family owns that connects the two properties).

I understand the importance of not putting pressure on the pup to enter situations they are not yet comfortable with and I also understand the need to be able to pay close attention to the pup so I know when they are moving out of the Think and Learn zone. The class is only an hour long so I am usually home by 8:15. I go to bed anywhere between 9:00 and 10:00.   On nights that I do not have to work I like to keep busy and like to be outside. I often go to local parks to take my dog for a walk or I have a couple friends who live downtown whose houses I will park at and they will join me for a walk. My mom sometimes joins me on these walks too, which would give me the option of bringing my dog along with the pup if I wanted. My dog is getting older and tires more easily so I do foresee leaving her home many nights, especially because its important to have lots of one on one time with the pup.   My weekends are very similar to my free week nights. I do hold a 1 hour seminar every other Sunday at Petco, but other than that my schedule is open. I live out in the country and my family owns a lot of property so I like to be outside doing things around the yard, walking the trails, or go for walks in the city and take advantage of the different events going on.    My mom has offered to help out with the pup as much as possible and my brother is also currently available during the day to help out. They both live two houses down from me (there's actually a trail through fields and woods our family owns that connects the two properties). I also plan on taking a week off when I get a pup so that I have time to help the pup adjust and establish a routine. This time will help me get a good idea of if and when the pup will need to be let out or exercised while I am at work."

Our lifestyle: Tony (my husband) runs the Jamestown 4-H Center.

I am home with our four children that we homeschool. Our children's ages are 8yrs, 7yrs, 5yrs, and 3yrs.  Since we homeschool we are home a lot. We have a nice sized, fenced-in backyard that the kids spend a lot of time in. Three of our children LOVE dogs. We had our own dogs, but in the past year have had to put both of them down. Our kids are the kind who will lay on the floor petting and loving on the dog. I would prefer a dog with a more calm temperament.  We live on the end of a cul-de-sac in a small town. It's fairly quiet with little to no traffic.. Several of our neighbors have dogs.   Weekends we go to church on Sunday and do AWANA. It's probably the day we are out the most.  During the weekday afternoons we tend to be running around to piano lessons, woodworking class, homeschool group, bible study. We would like to think that we could bring the pup (once they get a little older to many of these things) I have already received some permissions.    We have been in this area for 4.5yrs and don't have any plans on moving any time soon. We have family in NJ and try to travel there about once every 8 weeks or so. We also have a pop-up camper and try to go camping at least one weekend each month. We are hoping that it is OK to take our pup with us for these trips?  Our dogs have always just traveled with us everywhere.  I guess we would also request a pup that doesn't mind being in the car because we are about 30 mins from just about everything, and it will be over an hour drive to get to our GEB class each week.  We have been prepping our kids for some time about getting a GEB pup.    We began about 10 months ago with reading some books; like Follow My Leader and Through Otis' Eyes. Watching documentaries, etc...  As far as exercising; I will be walking our dog each morning, playing in the yard with the kids (like hide & seek and fetch), and my husband usually does shorter evening walks and running/biking on the weekends.  If we can avoid a dog with a strong prey drive/ a chaser, that would help me with the kids in the yard as they tend to run around a ton.  That's all I can think of. We are planning on getting our own pup when our GEB pup is about a year old if everything is working out. We are looking at female Golden Retrievers. For our GEB pup we were going to ask if we could have a female shepherd or a female yellow lab. Of course we would be happy to raise any pup that you think is the best match for our family."

As far as exercising; I will be walking our dog each morning, playing in the yard with the kids (like hide & seek and fetch), and my husband usually does shorter evening walks and running/biking on the weekends.  If we can avoid a dog with a strong prey drive/ a chaser, that would help me with the kids in the yard as they tend to run around a ton.  That's all I can think of. We are planning on getting our own pup when our GEB pup is about a year old if everything is working out. We are looking at female Golden Retrievers. For our GEB pup we were going to ask if we could have a female shepherd or a female yellow lab. Of course we would be happy to raise any pup that you think is the best match for our family."

During the week JJ works in DC and typically leaves the house around 5:45a so he can take the puppy out to get busy early in the morning before he leaves for work. He returns home around 4:45p. Occasionally he also has the opportunity to work from home. The first half of this year he has been involved in a lot of travel for work but due to the program he will be home a lot more starting at the end of May. Rachel has a more flexible schedule and is able to work from home a majority of the time. She typically goes into her office either in DC or Alexandria, 2-3 days a week for 6-8 hours. She doesnÛªt leave until 7:30 so the puppy will be out again, fed, and let out a final time and crated before she leaves. When the puppy is ready, it will go to work with her on those days. Prior to that, our neighborÛªs son, who will be home on vacation from college, lives å_ mile away and will be available to let the puppy out and feed between 10:30-11:30. Rachel is usually home by 2:30. In the afternoons/evenings during the week we tend to stay low key with an occasional activity one or two nights a week. We will go to the gym or go on a run in the park. Although we will have to be more conscious of our timing, we do have a 5 year old German Shepherd (Harper) who we have make sure gets adequate exercise and try to incorporate her into our plans as much as possible (As we will with the puppy). On the weekends, we stay fairly busy however we are lucky to live in a very dog-friendly town where even pets are welcome out and in stores. We enjoy taking Harper with us hiking, to the park or to the beach. We do like to take weekend trips once or twice a month but when we do travel, it is normally no more than three hours away and we normally take Harper with us. We live in a single level ranch home with a finished basement (with carpeted stairs). We do have a fenced in back yard with a 6-foot wooden fence which will give Harper and the puppy room a safe area to run around and play."

Rachel has a more flexible schedule and is able to work from home a majority of the time. She typically goes into her office either in DC or Alexandria, 2-3 days a week for 6-8 hours. She doesnÛªt leave until 7:30 so the puppy will be out again, fed, and let out a final time and crated before she leaves. When the puppy is ready, it will go to work with her on those days. Prior to that, our neighborÛªs son, who will be home on vacation from college, lives å_ mile away and will be available to let the puppy out and feed between 10:30-11:30. Rachel is usually home by 2:30. In the afternoons/evenings during the week we tend to stay low key with an occasional activity one or two nights a week. We will go to the gym or go on a run in the park. Although we will have to be more conscious of our timing, we do have a 5 year old German Shepherd (Harper) who we have make sure gets adequate exercise and try to incorporate her into our plans as much as possible (As we will with the puppy). On the weekends, we stay fairly busy however we are lucky to live in a very dog-friendly town where even pets are welcome out and in stores. We enjoy taking Harper with us hiking, to the park or to the beach. We do like to take weekend trips once or twice a month but when we do travel, it is normally no more than three hours away and we normally take Harper with us. We live in a single level ranch home with a finished basement (with carpeted stairs). We do have a fenced in back yard with a 6-foot wooden fence which will give Harper and the puppy room a safe area to run around and play."

I will be finished for the semester May 10th, so will be able to devote lots of time towards working with the young puppy.  We have a rescue dog, Piper, who is a Black Mouth Cur mix from All Breed Rescue.  We have had her since Oct 9th, 2011.  She will be 2yrs April 15th.  Normally during the week we are up between 6 and 630 either getting ready for school, work, or the 2yr old little boy is coming and let the dog to go out to go potty.  I always take Piper for a walk whether it is just out back for a 15-20 min walk if I have an early class to make, or if I donÛªt have an early class we will go to Mills Riverside Park and go up in the woods, usually a 1-2hr walk/hike.  My mom is usually always home unless she has an appointment or shopping to do, if so she is only gone for a few hours.   Three days out of the week she takes care for her nieceÛªs son who is 2yrs old, usually 7:30am to about 5pm at the latest. Ethan is at school from 730am-3pm.  My dad is at work from 7am to 5:30pm.  I usually work 3 days out of the week from 10-4.  I usually will take Piper to the park again for another walk with friends around 4 for about an hour, hour and half.  We usually have dinner between 5 -6:30.  Sometimes depending on the weather I may walk Piper in our neighbor hood for about 30min.  Then we all normally go to bed around 10pm.  Then on the weekend we are even more flexible and donÛªt do too much.  Getting up can be the same when the puppy comes, but usually sleep in a bit till 7-7:30.  We usually I will take Piper for walk out back in the morning when we get up and then another walk later in the afternoon and maybe once more after dinner.  Usually Gary (my dad) will go to the dump and grocery shopping.  During the winter we usually go skiing on Sundays from 8-4.       	We live in a good size neighborhood with houses not super close to each other.  We have about a 1acre lot, with lots of open area and some woods in the front.  Like I said above, there is a path behind our house with a field and woods to walk.  In a neighboring neighborhood there are more paths and woods to walk in.  We live close by to the elementary, middle and high schools.  There are sidewalks we plan on driving too to walk there for practice.    	It will be easy to make the puppy a part of our family.  We will love being able to take it to soccer games, on car rides to places, walk places, go downtown Burlington with it.  We have a very flexible schedule to fit it into our daily lives and to meet the requirements need to socialize, train, and love this puppy.  My mom or I will be able to exercise it and train it in the morning before I leave or the baby comes.  She will be able to correct and praise the dog in the house with the 2yr and also be able to give it kennel time while still near the puppy.  My mom or I will be home to feed it and take it out every 20-30 minutes if it is out wandering or after it comes out of the kennel.  Ethan will be home around 3 and will be able to play and exercise the puppy and take it out.  When I get home from work I will also be able to train and work with it, play and exercise it, and feed it dinner.   Once we are home we are usually home for the night, so being able to exercise/play with the puppy before time for bed is doable.  I will get up in the middle of the night to make the 3-4hr time to take it out to ÛÏGet BusyÛ.    We are planning on going to Maine July 19th to July 29th and will probably need a sitter for that time.  If a sitter is unavailable then I am willing to stay home and continue care for the puppy."

I work very part time at the Anne Arundel Community College and will arrange my work schedule to fit my needs to care for the pup. Limited work schedule would ensure someone is always home, We do have season tickets to sporting events - football and basketball -  and may need a sitter occasionally depending on the duration/ length of the game (not often).  A typical day for us both is up by 7AM. Shower/ Breakfast by 8, Read paper/ check email by 9. Household chores/ errands depending on season by Noon and may carry over into the afternoon. Dinner prep and cleanup usually from 5 to 7. TV or relaxing from 7-11. Usually in bed by 11 or 12.

I will be finished for the semester May 10th, so will be able to devote lots of time towards working with the young puppy.  We have a rescue dog, Piper, who is a Black Mouth Cur mix from All Breed Rescue.  We have had her since Oct 9th, 2011.  She will be 2yrs April 15th.  Normally during the week we are up between 6 and 630 either getting ready for school, work, or the 2yr old little boy is coming and let the dog to go out to go potty.  I always take Piper for a walk whether it is just out back for a 15-20 min walk if I have an early class to make, or if I donÛªt have an early class we will go to Mills Riverside Park and go up in the woods, usually a 1-2hr walk/hike.  My mom is usually always home unless she has an appointment or shopping to do, if so she is only gone for a few hours.   Three days out of the week she takes care for her nieceÛªs son who is 2yrs old, usually 7:30am to about 5pm at the latest. Ethan is at school from 730am-3pm.  My dad is at work from 7am to 5:30pm.  I usually work 3 days out of the week from 10-4.  I usually will take Piper to the park again for another walk with friends around 4 for about an hour, hour and half.  We usually have dinner between 5 -6:30.  Sometimes depending on the weather I may walk Piper in our neighbor hood for about 30min.  Then we all normally go to bed around 10pm.  Then on the weekend we are even more flexible and donÛªt do too much.  Getting up can be the same when the puppy comes, but usually sleep in a bit till 7-7:30.  We usually I will take Piper for walk out back in the morning when we get up and then another walk later in the afternoon and maybe once more after dinner.  Usually Gary (my dad) will go to the dump and grocery shopping.  During the winter we usually go skiing on Sundays from 8-4.       	We live in a good size neighborhood with houses not super close to each other.  We have about a 1acre lot, with lots of open area and some woods in the front.  Like I said above, there is a path behind our house with a field and woods to walk.  In a neighboring neighborhood there are more paths and woods to walk in.  We live close by to the elementary, middle and high schools.  There are sidewalks we plan on driving too to walk there for practice.    	It will be easy to make the puppy a part of our family.  We will love being able to take it to soccer games, on car rides to places, walk places, go downtown Burlington with it.  We have a very flexible schedule to fit it into our daily lives and to meet the requirements need to socialize, train, and love this puppy.  My mom or I will be able to exercise it and train it in the morning before I leave or the baby comes.  She will be able to correct and praise the dog in the house with the 2yr and also be able to give it kennel time while still near the puppy.  My mom or I will be home to feed it and take it out every 20-30 minutes if it is out wandering or after it comes out of the kennel.  Ethan will be home around 3 and will be able to play and exercise the puppy and take it out.  When I get home from work I will also be able to train and work with it, play and exercise it, and feed it dinner.   Once we are home we are usually home for the night, so being able to exercise/play with the puppy before time for bed is doable.

We enjoyed being part of GEB for several years and now that our daughter is schoolage feel we have the time to committ back to volunteering. Oh, and our labs are age 11 1/2 years and 14 1/2. Both are still quite active - playful - and are walked daily - I think they both would accept a new pup in the home without any challenge. Only other random thought...though I have been partial to female dogs in the past, I am kind of curious if a male dog may be a good fit for us (for really not good reason). Our other two dogs are fixed, of course. Thanks for all you do! We are so proud to support your mission."

Some days I volunteer at a local food pantry perhaps once a month, but otherwise my daytime schedule centers on reading, home improvement projects, house maintenance projects, and errands.  In the summer I may go for a mid-day swim and also an evening swim at our local pool club.  In the winter I might do the mid-day swim if I re-join the gym at a local college.  If I take another class in January my activity will likely focus on class readings, etc. Evenings are devoted to meal preparation/cleanup, F2F conversation with Paula over dinner and for me, typically watching a sporting event or movie on tv if I do not have a scheduled meeting or class.  The evening classes are usually no more than one evening per week.  These classes vary and depend upon my free time and interest level.  I also occasionally have evening meetings for organizations that I support e.g. a church committee meeting, and I also serve on the board of a local organization ÛÒ Hilltop Hanover Farm.  These groups meet no more frequently than once monthly for a 2-3 hour period. I attend choir practice weekly 1+ hours in the evening.  These absences from the home can generally be covered by my wife Paula who works from home and could be with the pup for feeding, and other exercise and outside activities.    On weekends we both attend to Saturday errands some of which could develop into training exercises. We typically socialize with friends on Saturday evening, e.g. dining out, hosting a dinner party, or seeing a movie. On Sunday we are typically both at church.  I go early for choir rehearsal and then depending on what is happening typically stay a bit afterwards for our coffee hour.  This entire period of time would be between 2-3 hours.  I could see this experience also being a training exercise for the pup as he/she gets older so that the pup can be acquainted with different sounds and people contact.  We have no other pets at home and our children are grown.  In fact, one is engaged and will marry in March 2013.  This is a one week trip in mid-to-late March 2013 that will require international travel. We live in a private residence.    On the health front I am in good health at age 62, however I will be consulting an orthopedist soon for slight knee pain.  Depending upon the results I may require minor knee surgery, but that is not known at this point -- just a worse-case scenario.

We do travel for two weeks during the summer to a Marriott condo that does not allow pets.  Not sure if they would make an exception for a guide dog in training or not, so that would be the only time we may need another puppy raiser to take the puppy."

Our schedule will include my wife doing morning activities since she gets up very early, I get the kids to school by 8am, then I am home all day, with erands, house work, internet sales and shipping, except when I go into the field for Pace Un. Then I am gone for no more than 3 - 3/12 hours. I do a lot of paperwork late at night so I can be up for the puppy as need be. I am sending this now for fear that I will have to retype everything a 3rd time..."

My typical work day begins at 5:00 am.  I leave the house around 6:15 am after taking a shower and getting dressed.  I arrive home sometime around 6 and 7 pm in the evening.  I watch the news, help the youngest with homework, eat dinner, read or do more paper work and go to bed at around 10pm. My weekends are usually dedicated to spending time with my kids and husband and household chores such as cleaning and laundry.   I spend about 5-6 hours of Saturday or Sunday to complete school work.  We attend Mass on Sunday evening at 5:30 and once or twice a month I visit my father in Gardiner, New York for about four hours.  I have public school holidays which include: July and August off,  1 week in December off, 1 week in February off and one week in March or April off.  I have an artificial hip and metal bar with nuts and bolts through my pelvis which affects my ability to run, walk for long periods of time carrying heavy items, and I do limp when I walk if I have exerted myself too much physically."

However, I'm an absolute homebody and when I do go over to friends, it wouldn't be a problem to take the pup with me.     During this coming school year, I will be a senior at Marcellus High School where I participate in various extracurricular activities. Sometimes I'm very busy during the nights, but I do my best to get home as early as possible. Most weekends I am usually home studying!"

My wife passed away 8 years ago. I have always wanted a dog, but told myself I wouldn't have one until I was sure I could take care of it. Now that I have been retired for 3 years and my children are older, I think now is a good time. I recognize that a potential 15 year commitment may be a little agressive since I don't know what I will be getting into. I think raising a GEB puppy will give me the proven knowledge to raise a puppy successfully. Just reading the materials makes me sure that If this was my own puppy, I would be proud of his behaviors when I took him somewhere.     We live in a townhouse with a family next to us in the same building and neighbors in the next building about 25 feet away. The folks in the same building have no dogs, but 3 indoor cats. They have 2 children...a 6 year old girl and a 1 year old boy. The ones in the building next to us is adopting an 11 year old girl this summer and they have a very obnoxious chihuahua. They don't leash their dog and I anticipate it being a problem at some point this summer. The folks across the street have a 3 year old Puggle and the unit attached to them have a beagle and a terrier and 3 cats. The cats are always roaming the neighborhood and the beagle is never leashed.     I am home all day unless I am doing errands...grocery shopping, pick up a script, stop at the bank, Dunkin Donuts for breakfast, etc. There is no reason the pup wouldn't/couldn't go with me everytime I leave the house. I volunteer at the local middle school on Thursdays and they have already said it would be OK if the pup came with me after he is house trained. My son has already checked with the high school and they have said he could have show and tell days there so the puppy if exposed to about 1500 kids moving in the aisles after each class.    We have a camp for the summer. We would take the dog to camp with us. The camp is right on the water so he could swim. We have a 60 foot dock and a boat which he could certainly ride with us. The neighbors there are very good. One has a 13 year old yellow lab and the other is rarely there. Their nephew come now and then and has a Rotweiller.  We are at camp 4 to 5 days a week during the summer...mid-April to late October.    We are planning a cruise April 2013, usually gone for 7-9 days, so would need a sitter during that time.    I would like a female yellow lab, on the whiter side if possible. I would like to request that the name isn't Sue, Susan, or Suzanne as my wifes name was Susan and while I wouldn't have any trouble with those names, out of respect for my in-laws  I don't think those names would be appropriate.    I am a morning person whereas my sons are more afternoon to evening/night. I would hope for a puppy who isn't high energy, but one who doesn't mind moving and going out and learning new things."

Roosevelt Vets were recommended by my neighbors, but I haven't checked them out yet. I don't know the policy for puppies. I had a brood dog for 3 months, and then all vet care was provided by Guiding Eyes. I don't know what the case is for puppies. I have a new house that I built with radiant floor heat throughout which the animals love. I have a fenced back yard."

I am taking classes full-time and I am not working so that I can get through the master's program more quickly.  I am not planning to get a job until I am finished with the degree.  I will graduate in December or next May, and will hopefully find a job in a library afterward.  In my experience library jobs tend to offer fairly flexible schedules, and when the time comes I don't foresee a problem with accommodating the pup's needs.  For now, though, my schedule is almost entirely flexible.    I wake up in the morning anywhere between 8:30 and 10:30, but I will adapt this to fit the puppyÛªs schedule.  I sleep later now because I donÛªt have to be a certain place by a certain time, but with a pup to look after, this would be different.  I wake up, have breakfast, read for a little while to give myself time to wake up, and then take a shower and get ready for the day.  My day is pretty simple because I spend most of my time reading textbooks, writing papers, and working on assignments during the day.  Usually I go to Starbucks or the library to study for a couple of hours in the morning or afternoon (one or the other). While the pup is on a schedule where he needs to go out every hour or so, I plan to stay at home during the day to attend to his bathroom needs.  I could study at Starbucks again occasionally when the pup is old enough to stay in a crate for a few hours, but I can study effectively at home so this isnÛªt a requirement.  If I donÛªt go to Starbucks to study, I like to go on a walk around downtown White Plains, go on an errand to the grocery store or Target, or go to the gym downstairs.  These activities each usually take about an hour.    Michael gets home around six in the evenings, and we usually have dinner between six and eight.  We watch a TV show or read in the evenings, and I spend time knitting or working on homework.  I have class from 6-10 pm on Mondays and Thursdays, and I have to concentrate most of my attention on class during this time.  Michael is home by the time class starts or shortly thereafter.  He can take responsibility for the puppy on those nights.  Once or twice a week we go out for a few hours in the evening to go to a movie or hang out with friendsÛÓthis is of course flexible.  On weekends we bake, run errands, go for walks, and do chores around the house.  For example, we might go to a yarn store or the grocery store.  Sometimes we visit NYC for the day.  We donÛªt need to do this until the puppy is old enough to handle it, and we could spend shorter periods of time there so as not to overwhelm him.  We usually take the train but driving the car is an option, too.  We are both very willing to plan our activities around the puppyÛªs needs and as you can see, my schedule in particular is very flexible.    I left my car in Atlanta, and IÛªm planning to leave it there at least until the ice and snow driving season is over.  I can walk everywhere I need to go during the day: the grocery store, Target, bookstore, Starbucks, library, etc. are all within easy walking distance.  Michael has a car and will be able to take the puppy and me where we need to go.  ItÛªs also an option for me to drive him to work and use the car during the dayÛÓas long as itÛªs not snowing.  The puppy will be able to get used to riding in a car.    We live on the sixth floor of an apartment building in White Plains.  I donÛªt really know our neighbors, but theyÛªre quiet.  Other dogs live in our building, so hopefully we will pick up some tips in class about how to handle running into these dogs on our way outside.  We have a one-bedroom apartment.  I will have time to take the dog on walks during the day so he wonÛªt be too hyper or feel cooped up inside.    The main thing that I wanted to talk to you about is that one of the conditions of my move to New York was that I would be able to visit my family in Atlanta occasionally.  I am very close to my mom, so it is important to me to be able to see her.  Michael and I had planned for me to fly to Atlanta approximately once every two months or so.  Since I can continue my class work there, I had planned to spend about a week there at a time.  It is important to me that I am able to visit with my family sometimes, but I will make it a priority to plan these trips in the best interest of the puppy.  Michael and I have thought about options to take care of the puppyÛªs needs in this situation.  With all the dogs in our apartment building, we could find a responsible dog walker to let the dog out at lunchtime if this is acceptable to Guiding Eyes.  If not, Michael could come home during his lunch break if necessary.  Also, I donÛªt know what the Guiding Eyes policy is on bringing puppies on airplanes once they are old enough to handle it, but if Guiding Eyes and the airline would allow it, IÛªd be willing to bring the dog with me so he would have experience with flying.  My priority is to plan visiting around the puppyÛªs needs.    Finally, IÛªd like to request that we get a Lab rather than a German Shepherd if possible.  I have allergies, and allergy medicine helps enough that I am fine around Labs (my familyÛªs dog, Ivy, is a Lab) but I donÛªt think I would do as well with a German Shepherd.

The puppy will be able to get used to riding in a car.    We live on the sixth floor of an apartment building in White Plains.  I donÛªt really know our neighbors, but theyÛªre quiet.  Other dogs live in our building, so hopefully we will pick up some tips in class about how to handle running into these dogs on our way outside.  We have a one-bedroom apartment.  I will have time to take the dog on walks during the day so he wonÛªt be too hyper or feel cooped up inside.    The main thing that I wanted to talk to you about is that one of the conditions of my move to New York was that I would be able to visit my family in Atlanta occasionally.  I am very close to my mom, so it is important to me to be able to see her.  Michael and I had planned for me to fly to Atlanta approximately once every two months or so.  Since I can continue my class work there, I had planned to spend about a week there at a time.  It is important to me that I am able to visit with my family sometimes, but I will make it a priority to plan these trips in the best interest of the puppy.  Michael and I have thought about options to take care of the puppyÛªs needs in this situation.  With all the dogs in our apartment building, we could find a responsible dog walker to let the dog out at lunchtime if this is acceptable to Guiding Eyes.  If not, Michael could come home during his lunch break if necessary.  Also, I donÛªt know what the Guiding Eyes policy is on bringing puppies on airplanes once they are old enough to handle it, but if Guiding Eyes and the airline would allow it, IÛªd be willing to bring the dog with me so he would have experience with flying.  My priority is to plan visiting around the puppyÛªs needs.    Finally, IÛªd like to request that we get a Lab rather than a German Shepherd if possible.  I have allergies, and allergy medicine helps enough that I am fine around Labs (my familyÛªs dog, Ivy, is a Lab) but I donÛªt think I would do as well with a German Shepherd.    I tried to include everything I could think of about what my life is like--hopefully I didn't write too much!  Please call or email if you have any questions or want to discuss anything!  Thanks :)"

I am taking classes full-time and I am not working so that I can get through the master's program more quickly.  I am not planning to get a job until I am finished with the degree.  I will graduate in December or next May, and will hopefully find a job in a library afterward.  In my experience library jobs tend to offer fairly flexible schedules, and when the time comes I don't foresee a problem with accommodating the pup's needs.  For now, though, my schedule is almost entirely flexible.    I wake up in the morning anywhere between 8:30 and 10:30, but I will adapt this to fit the puppyÛªs schedule.  I sleep later now because I donÛªt have to be a certain place by a certain time, but with a pup to look after, this would be different.  I wake up, have breakfast, read for a little while to give myself time to wake up, and then take a shower and get ready for the day.  My day is pretty simple because I spend most of my time reading textbooks, writing papers, and working on assignments during the day.  Usually I go to Starbucks or the library to study for a couple of hours in the morning or afternoon (one or the other). While the pup is on a schedule where he needs to go out every hour or so, I plan to stay at home during the day to attend to his bathroom needs.  I could study at Starbucks again occasionally when the pup is old enough to stay in a crate for a few hours, but I can study effectively at home so this isnÛªt a requirement.  If I donÛªt go to Starbucks to study, I like to go on a walk around downtown White Plains, go on an errand to the grocery store or Target, or go to the gym downstairs.  These activities each usually take about an hour.    Michael gets home around six in the evenings, and we usually have dinner between six and eight.  We watch a TV show or read in the evenings, and I spend time knitting or working on homework.  I have class from 6-10 pm on Mondays and Thursdays, and I have to concentrate most of my attention on class during this time.  Michael is home by the time class starts or shortly thereafter.  He can take responsibility for the puppy on those nights.  Once or twice a week we go out for a few hours in the evening to go to a movie or hang out with friendsÛÓthis is of course flexible.  On weekends we bake, run errands, go for walks, and do chores around the house.  For example, we might go to a yarn store or the grocery store.  Sometimes we visit NYC for the day.  We donÛªt need to do this until the puppy is old enough to handle it, and we could spend shorter periods of time there so as not to overwhelm him.  We usually take the train but driving the car is an option, too.  We are both very willing to plan our activities around the puppyÛªs needs and as you can see, my schedule in particular is very flexible.    I left my car in Atlanta, and IÛªm planning to leave it there at least until the ice and snow driving season is over.  I can walk everywhere I need to go during the day: the grocery store, Target, bookstore, Starbucks, library, etc. are all within easy walking distance.  Michael has a car and will be able to take the puppy and me where we need to go.  ItÛªs also an option for me to drive him to work and use the car during the dayÛÓas long as itÛªs not snowing.

On a typical day Terry will get up first, take the puppy outside to get busy, feed the puppy, and then do some training.  Terry will take the puppy to work with her, frequently taking him from his crate for training and exercise.  Ann will work with the puppy after school and in the evening.  Bill and Terry will work with the puppy again in the evening, taking the puppy for a long walk before bedtime.  We have another dog, Frampton, a 3/4 Golden Retriever 1/4 Poodle mix who is a seven year old male who expects to be walked and played with daily.  Frampton is not particulalry good with other dogs, usually barking at the initial meeting.  However, he does settle down quickly and accepts the other dog.   We live in a two story house in the Village of East Aurora.  We have a large kitchen/family room where we spend most of our time.  This area is closed off from the rest of the house which will make it easier to monitor the puppy's behavior.  Our location in the village will allow us to have many socialization opportunities.  We are all in good shape physically so will not have a problem exercising the dog.  We plan on taking him to local parks and for hikes.  Terry's parents are in a senior living facility and she stops by to check on them frequently and will be taking the puppy with her.  We are concerned that there is not much diversity in our village, so we are planning on taking the puppy into the city for more socialization activities.    Ann will be leaving for college in August and Bill will be away for a five week period in late May and June."

I live on the top of a hill in Sherman, CT on a very quiet road which is great for walks and there are plenty of trails and parks for exercise. My yard is not fenced in.

I've been volunteering a fair amount at CDC in the BK and driving for Kathi Carey which I'd like to continue doing as much as possible. My regular BK session is 3-7PM on Thursdays but I often fill in at other times and I drive as required. I'm often at the CDC 3-4 times a week helping out in some capacity. I very much enjoy that, but understand that my volunteering may be impacted by the time I need to devote to puppy raising. Maybe there's a balance that will work for all concerned.

We live in a single family home with a little less than 1 acre fenced in yard. We live in a neighborhood outside Brewster.

If Rick is traveling or doesn't have time then I make sure that the dogs get to relieve them self in the backyard.  8 am-breakfast with Rick and Ben, feed the dogs, make sure that Ben gets on the bus right before 9am.  9 am - walk the dogs, 1 mile or 3 mile circle.  10 am - leave for the barn.

The afternoon schedule varies during the weekdays depending on the kids' activities. We let the dogs out/take them on walks as we come and go. Sometimes the dogs, one by one or all of them, come with me to the barn. I like to take walks in the woods there.  The weekend schedule varies. We sleep in a little bit, go to the barn, take hikes, work around the house, soccer games.  I hope this helped.

The afternoon schedule varies during the weekdays depending on the kids' activities. We let the dogs out/take them on walks as we come and go. Sometimes the dogs, one by one or all of them, come with me to the barn. I like to take walks in the woods there.  The weekend schedule varies. We sleep in a little bit, go to the barn, take hikes, work around the house, soccer games.  I hope this helped. I realized that my schedule is difficult to pinpoint since I'm lucky enough not to have to be at work certain times. It also depends on if Rick is home working or traveling. He makes sure the dogs get to go out regularly during the day. I hope this helps."

Apart from taking care of house and family, I really enjoy working with horses. I spend time at the barn almost every day. We have Nina, 11, and Ben, 8 years old, both of them are looking forward to help with the puppy. Our family also consists of three rescue dogs. Clyde, the oldest is 15 and in surprisingly good health and spirit. He is the king, he doesn't have the strength to reinforce it but it typically just takes a look from him to get the favorite dog bed to himself. Next is Kya, 12 years old and the lowest on the ladder among the dogs. Youngest is Molly 5 or 6 years old, she is a certified search and rescue dog, working in team with my husband. All three of them are collie/shepherd/??? mixes.  We take weekend trips to our cabin in the Catskills and go to Sweden for 2-3 weeks every summer. We live in a single family home with a little less than 1 acre fenced in yard. We live in a neighborhood outside Brewster.  My M-F days looks similar to each other and go like this. 6.20 am- wake up and prepare lunch for both children, the oldest leaves on the bus at 7.10 am. If Rick is traveling or doesn't have time then I make sure that the dogs get to relieve them self in the backyard.  8 am-breakfast with Rick and Ben, feed the dogs, make sure that Ben gets on the bus right before 9am.  9 am - walk the dogs, 1 mile or 3 mile circle.  10 am - leave for the barn.  Noon-2pm - back from the barn, grocery shopping, house chores, errands etc  2.30 pm-pick up Nina, bring her to the barn  Either pick up Ben at his dismissal or greet him at home 4.20 pm.

My kids are self-sufficient and get dressed by themselves, get their breakfast and lunch and head out the door between 7-7.30 for school. My daily routine is then very flexible, in the morning I do exercise at the gym or at home, if at the gym I am generally back home about 10 am. In the mornings I also clean the house put on Laundry and check emails. My other daily tasks are running errands such as shopping. My other activities that I do on a regular basis is attend a sewing group once a week, I try to hit golf balls or play golf, I attend my Group MAWA where we have a pot-luck luncheon once a month, or I catch up with friends for a walk and coffee. Other than that my time is quite flexible.  The kids start coming home at 2.45-3.30 pm they have various after school activites that I need to get them too and these vary each day and change throughout the year depending on the sport season. 6.30 pm we are normally home for dinner, the kids then get ready for bed at 8.00 pm. I then watch TV, sew or read until 10.30 pm when I retire to bed. My husbands job requires that we occasionally are required to attend evening functions, but the kids are at an age where they stay at home on their own. These functions occur about 3-4 times a month. Our 14 year old son is taking a very active role in this process and I feel confident that he will be able to step up to help with the Pup.

When we go to visit family we take our dog with us.  We would have to determine if this works with the GEB pup.  We have 3 kids, the oldest graduated from UCONN this past spring & has recently found a job and for now is living at home.  The other two are a junior & senior in high school.  They are both involved in sports, and we are avid supporters of their sports.  We go to hockey games, soccer games & lacrosse games often.

Daily I tend to anything and everything my family needs which consists mostly of cleaning, cooking, running errands, keeping in touch with family, and taking my son to various practices and games and picking him up from school.  On the weekend  we are typically having or attending some kind of family/friend gathering and or attending our sons baseball games. Occasionally we will road trip to see our sons at their various schools but since the end of the school year is here the soonest that would happen would be typically the end of September or in October.  We usually take a family summer driving vacation so puppy would be able to join us.  The only inflexible time when we will not be able to have the puppy with us is when we fly out of town the day after Christmas for a yearly family vacation. We live on a cul-de-sac on a very quiet street and have a very large fenced in back yard that is great for puppies/dogs. My 2 sisters have dogs one a 3 year old lab and the other a 1 year old golden retriever that will also be  optional socialization experiences."

My sister Carly has a schedule for collage that is different every day but also has work and other obligations. On the weekends we all have off so we either relax at home or go out shopping for various things, hang out with friends and family, or even go on a short trip (not likely) Also on Sundays we go to church in the mornings or at night. During holidays and breaks we usually stay home unless there is a planned vacation or a suprise vacation (also not likely)Summer schedule ~ Hope, Cathy, Carly have off from school and work and dad does not, yet takes off many weeks for vacation time. We all stay home for most of the summer, hanging out with friends and family, enjoying sports like softball(adult league), going to a variety of celebrations, going to church and church events, relaxing. The only planned vacation that should be worried about this year is our trip to camp hickory hill with friends, it is occuring in the 2nd week of August for about a week (don't know specific dates yet but will be arranged). We live in a medium sized house with a very large back yard and front yard. The back yard is where we spend majority of our time also includes an above ground pool. We have one house behind us and one house right next to us on one side and a church blocked by trees on the other. Live on a busy street but our house is far from the road. Neighbors are close by(no sidewalk though on street) Since our schedule is busy with sports and other events we have a busy life sometimes and other times we have nothing to do.

The lesson times vary from 42 minutes long (1 class period) to 84 minutes long (2 class periods back to back). When I am out of my office for lessons, my office mate is out on her own lessons as well and the office will be empty.  The puppy will not be going on lessons with me due to the distraction factor for my students and because this will be a good time for the puppy to sleep.  11:45 ÛÒ 12:20 ÛÒ During this time I am doing lunch duty in while the students eat.  12:20 ÛÒ 1:07 ÛÒ My lunch time.  I am usually done eating in 10 minutes, so the rest of this time is free.  1:07 ÛÒ 2:30 ÛÒ This time is 2 - 42 minute long  lessons or 1 ÛÒ 84 minute long lesson with a student at which time the puppy will remain in my office.  3:15 ÛÒ 4:00 ÛÒ Wrap up the day.  4:00 ÛÒ 5:00 ÛÒ Drive time (or when I have my puppy, I will use this opportunity to go for an afternoon walk before heading home because I will have access to sidewalks, etc.)  Due to having so many animals, at least once a week there is a trip to the pet store for supplies before jumping on the freeway for home.  About one other time during the week there is usually another errand that needs to be run.  And Thursdays I will be driving straight from work to puppy class in Berea.  When I arrive home, the first thing I do is take care of the cats, chickens and make dinner.  The rest of the evening is spent doing household chores or filling empty time.  10:00 ÛÒ 11:00 ÛÒ Bedtime  Saturdays and Sundays ÛÒI use this time usually to grocery shop if need be or run other errands.  It is pretty flexible.  An important note:  Paul (my husband) is away at school at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, MI.  He is getting his MasterÛªs in Vision Rehabilitation Therapy.  I travel up there to see him 2 times a month.  It is a 5 hour drive one way.  The typical trip is a Saturday morning into a Sunday afternoon.  Paul lives in an apartment on campus and his resident advisor is fine with him having me as a visitor with a GEB puppy.  This will only be until mid-May.  At this time in May, Paul will be moving back home to Fredericktown to start his internship in Columbus.   Our lifestyle is pretty quiet and laid back.  Neither Paul nor I are excitable people, but we like to make the most out of life and have fun.  We have a fenced in yard and a house that comfortably fits 5 cats, my husband and I and a puppy/dog.  We like routine and predictability but are very flexible with the interruptions that can happen at any given day.  We are very grounded people.  I understand, firsthand, what this puppy will one day mean to a person who is blind.  Whereas I have had dogs all of my life (golden retrievers as a kid and my husbandsÛª two GEB labs) it has been a LONG time since I have had a puppy.  This puppy will be intergrated into every part of my life, from a full work day to evening free time to traveling to Kalamazoo every other weekend for the next 4 months to visit Paul.  I have a huge support group behind me, my husband, my family and my workplace.  The only thing my work place administration is worried about is barking (so a less vocal pup is a request of mine).  If it were a perfect world then I would be matched with a black lab boy puppy who is laid back and has a soft soul, but that is in the spirit of our dear Jake who we miss so much.  Any dog you match me with I will raise with the utmost love and respect and guidance so that this exceptional animalÛªs future career goal is met with success."

Jerry (father/husband) works in Manhattan and travels for work throughout the year.  Kathleen (mother/wife) is a stay at home mom and therefore will be the main puppy raiser.  Megan (10) and Kylie (7) are active children that are excited to work with a pup.  We had a Lab for 13 years that was an integral part of our family.  Both of the girl's first words where his name, Jack.  We live on a private lane in Westport.  There are many children and dogs in the neighborhood -- but no sidewalks.  The family spends most of our time on the first floor of our private house.  The bedrooms are all upstairs.  A typical weekday is hectic in the morning with Jerry leaving before anyone else is awake.  Kathleen gets up with the children and gets them to school.  About once a week this entails a 7:30 carpool with 4 other children.  Ideally we will then walk to the bus by 8:10 (we drive if later).  Kathleen spends 3 mornings a week visiting Jerry's mother.  She has moderate Altzeihmer's and lives in Brookdale, and assisted living facility about 10 minutes away.  Kathleen plans to take the pup to Brookdale whenever possilbe.  Mrs. Doyle is a lifelong Lab lover and looks forward to interacting with the pup.    The later part of the morning/early afternoon would be dedicated to the pup and household chores & errands.  The girls are picked up from school at 3:15 and usually have activities right afterschool.  Mondays we have 3 additional girls come over before carpooling -- so it can be a bustling household.  Every Thursday afterschool, Kathleen leads a girl scout troop (she is a leader for both a 2nd & 5th grade troop at school).   After activities Kathleen cooks dinner while the girls complete their homework.  After dinner the girls often dance/jump around the house before bath & bedtime.  They are asleep by 8:30.  Kathleen & Jerry are up until about 11pm.  Weekends in our family vary.  We go to our home in Ludlow, VT (about 3 1/2 hours away) at least once a month (we sometimes stay for up to a week during the summer).  We have a small, 2-story private house on a residential street in town.  There are sidewalks, and weather permitting, we walk into town every morning.  We often ski, but usually only for a half day.  We will be flexible based on the pup's needs.  We look forward to taking the pup on hikes in the summer (on a leash of course!).    Our weekends in CT are filled with social and sport activities (spring soccer, summer swimming).  We often entertain -- both adults & children.  Every other month or so we visit family in Eastern Long Island.  We've already discussed bringing the pup with us.    We are all very excited to raise a pup and look forward to spending lots of time trainging the pup and exposing him/her to lot's of varied activities and environments!"

I have been known to take time off between pups and have been pup-sitting a lot since Maple went for her IFT - Nanette, Lani, Juliann, Harriet, and have had pup sleepovers frequently: Farley, Lolly.  What I've learned from these experiences is that all pups are different and all, every one of them, are so very special with lots of love to give."

We will be getting a new grandchild in the middle of June.  Sometime in June or July, I will need to go to Houston to help out and may stay  up to 4 weeks (probably a lot less) accordingly to how badly I am needed.  The plans for this travel and the time I will be needed have not been finalized yet.  I love GEB, I love the instructors and the other raisers and most of all - I love the pup.  I have been known to take time off between pups and have been pup-sitting a lot since Maple went for her IFT - Nanette, Lani, Juliann, Harriet, and have had pup sleepovers frequently: Farley, Lolly.  What I've learned from these experiences is that all pups are different and all, every one of them, are so very special with lots of love to give."

The actual raising of the dog, however, will be done by us.

We have a large terrace which is a great space for grooming and playing as well. Michael has a full-time (9 - 5 )job whereas I teach flute lessons outside our home around 8 hours/week.  My teaching hours are flexible so clearly I am at home during the day more than Michael is.  I have rehearsals one evening most weeks and Michael will be taking classes at NYU two evenings/week.  We are planning to cover for each other during those times.  My day typically revolves around straightening up the house (laundry, dishwasher, making the bed), checking never-ending e-mail, dealing with endless co-op business (I am the Treasurer, remember?), my teaching schedule, practicing, rehearsals (and performances) and my commitment to going to my local YMCA for an hour's exercise every weekday.  I raised one other GEB dog and found it extremely useful to take him with me everywhere I could: the bank, Eileen Fisher (they love dogs there), the Gap, Gracious Homes, the Post Office, the subway, buses - basically everyplace except places that serve or sell food.  However, we even found an outdoor restaurant in Cold Spring, NY where we could take him right to the table with us.  Both of us will make a point to take the pup with us wherever we go.  We live near both Central Park and Riverside Park and anticipate many walks with puppy there as well.    Finally, we have a home in the Poconos, Pa which provides an entirely different experience for our puppy.  We have found that all dogs (we have sat a few in addition to raising Saxon) love to explore a new, much larger house and - the best of all - learning to swim in the lake that is about 100' or so from the back of the house.  Also, it gives us a chance to take the dog on a ride in the car (1 1/2 to 2 hours), something we city-folk don't tend to do as much as our suburban counterparts.    We understand the challenges of incorporating the care of a young puppy into our lives that are already busy with work, family and housekeeping commitments, but we both love dogs (we both grew up with dogs as pets) and look forward to integrating our new, very special, puppy into our lives.  As for me, I find it nothing short of an honor and privilege to be part of the process that will enable a dog to open the world to a visually impaired person.  Ever since I was in seventh grade, I was fascinated with ""Seeing Eye Dogs"" and seriously considered a career working with Seeing Eye in Morristown, NJ.  Now, several years (only several :-)) and several careers later, I am not surprised to find myself still fascinated by the intelligence and almost magical ability of guide dogs to perform their jobs.

I raised one other GEB dog and found it extremely useful to take him with me everywhere I could: the bank, Eileen Fisher (they love dogs there), the Gap, Gracious Homes, the Post Office, the subway, buses - basically everyplace except places that serve or sell food.  However, we even found an outdoor restaurant in Cold Spring, NY where we could take him right to the table with us.  Both of us will make a point to take the pup with us wherever we go.  We live near both Central Park and Riverside Park and anticipate many walks with puppy there as well.    Finally, we have a home in the Poconos, Pa which provides an entirely different experience for our puppy.  We have found that all dogs (we have sat a few in addition to raising Saxon) love to explore a new, much larger house and - the best of all - learning to swim in the lake that is about 100' or so from the back of the house.  Also, it gives us a chance to take the dog on a ride in the car (1 1/2 to 2 hours), something we city-folk don't tend to do as much as our suburban counterparts.    We understand the challenges of incorporating the care of a young puppy into our lives that are already busy with work, family and housekeeping commitments, but we both love dogs (we both grew up with dogs as pets) and look forward to integrating our new, very special, puppy into our lives.  As for me, I find it nothing short of an honor and privilege to be part of the process that will enable a dog to open the world to a visually impaired person.  Ever since I was in seventh grade, I was fascinated with ""Seeing Eye Dogs"" and seriously considered a career working with Seeing Eye in Morristown, NJ.  Now, several years (only several :-)) and several careers later, I am not surprised to find myself still fascinated by the intelligence and almost magical ability of guide dogs to perform their jobs.  I am grateful to enjoy my life as it is right now:  with my new husband, teaching & playing music, managing my small apartment building in NYC, and raising a dog for GEB.  I will do the best I can to enable our next GEB puppy to be the best guide dog he can be."

We have two other well behaved dogs. Yardley loves when we have a GEB pup and enjoys demonstrating various skills. We are retired, physically active. We are surrounded by good walking paths/ sidewalks and socialization areas. Other residents in our community welcome our dogs and are happy to hear we  will raise a GEB pup. We attend meetings in our building, usually about an hour's duration. Our dogs are both female and we'd prefer another female. Service dogs are specifically noted in our handbook as being allowed to be with us in the dining room. We use the elevators many times a day.

I work in marketing for IBM and generally work remotely.    Our day begins around 8pm when Kieran gets up.  Lakshmi is normally gone to work at the hospital by this time so I get Kieran ready for the day (changing him, using the bathroom, getting dressed, and preparing breakfast).  Kieran knows a puppy is coming to live with us in January and is very excited to help with the training.  Kieran is very active and talkative and will need to be trained on how to approach the puppy (as well as vice-versa!)  KieranÛªs nanny comes at 9am and stays until 7pm, at which point Lakshmi is home from work.    During the week, I tend to work from a few different places.  I often start working at home and sometimes work from home all day!  Other days I go to an office in midtown near Bryant Park.  I am now driving to Westchester once a week to work in an office there but I expect that to be over by February or March at the latest.  The puppy is welcome at all these work places regardless.    During the day I normally go to the gym or for a run for an hour and the puppy would be left at home in the crate, until the pup is old enough to join me for sustained outdoor exercise.    In the evenings I tend to be out and about doing a variety of different things ÛÒ playing on a sports team, meeting a friend for a coffee or drink or dinner, going to lectures or meetups on topics IÛªm interested in, and other social activities.  IÛªm planning on integrating the puppy as much as possible into these activities.  I also hope that since I will be spending the day with the puppy that the pup will enjoy taking naps in the crate in the early evenings.  Overall though, I understand the pup is my first priority and I donÛªt have any activities that simply canÛªt be skipped.    I will also take the dog to visit my parents in Yonkers, where they have an enclosed yard perfect for playing and training.  They have three miniature schanzuers who are on the wild side.  It will definitely be good training on how to deal with less well-behaved dogs!  I have lots of friends in my UES neighborhood and in the building who have dogs.  They have all offered to have the pup over and introduce him to their pets.  We also have an enclosed playground outside the building where the dogs can play in a safe space.    I also enjoy traveling and plan on taking the puppy with me.  Normally I tend to travel abroad but while IÛªm raising the puppy I hope to learn more about places that are closer to home!  The pup will come with me in the car and we already have a one or two week trip planned to North Carolina via Washington, DC in late April.

I anticipate a typical day with a new pup will likely  start out when we normally get up in the morning---about 6:30 and proceed something like this:  6:30-Get Busy  6:40-Feed Pup  (I put on clothes) & Get Busy  6:50-Feed me  7:10 Get Busy  7:15-7:45 Reward with play  7:50-8:10 Start morning chores (breakfast dishes, make bed, etc) together.  8:10 Get Busy  8:15-8:45 Finish morning chores  8:45 Get Busy  (Are we Getting Busy too frequently?)  8:50-9:10 Work on specific behavior--eg class work.  9:10 Get Busy   9:15-9:30 Reward with play.  9:30-11:00  Kennel up with toys for nap.  I go to gym.  11:00-Get busy. Feed Pup. Get Busy.  The remainder of the day is generally open and my schedule is flexible.  If a return to work the pup will never need to stay in the crate for more hours than he can do comfortably  based on his age.   We have 2 children.  The oldest is 23 and lives and works in Baltimore.  The youngest is 20 and is a Junior in college.  He will be home for vacations and for the summer.  He is enthusiastic and supportive of this opportunity.  He loves animals, especially dogs, and is fully aware that there are critical skills and socialization ""rules"" for us to follow.  I look forward to your input regarding how I can best adjust my schedule to make the most of puppy training for the pup and for me!    What?  No question about Zu Zu's petals?"

Have 5 children ranging in age from 6 months to almost 12.  We homeschool, so our days vary, but we are home a lot during the day.  We normally go to the gym 4 times a week for 2.5 hours.  The evenings vary, we attend scouts, sports practices and our homeschool group activities or church activities (varies throughout the month)  We regularly attend church on Sunday and Saturday is filled with sports and other children's activities.  We frequently go to Annapolis or Baltimore to visit family. We are normally not away from home for large periods of time other than these visits to Maryland.  We live in a very active house, but are used to having a dog since ours just recently passed away (Nov '10).  We have an elderly cat but no other animals. Our good friends and neighbors have 3 dogs & 3 cats, so the opportunity to socialize is readily available.  They also have a horse (not next door, but at stable) which we will likely visit.  We live in a one story house, so opportunities to walk the  puppy up and down stairs will be something that we must look for.  Our schedule is VERY flexible."

As for work, I work Monday nights from 5:30-8PM, but just about all other times I am at home or running an occasional errand. Fortunately, though, I will have some support raising this dog. My boyfriend and his roommate will also be helping me and attending classes. The puppy will be living mostly at their apartment which is the entire second floor of a house and has a small non-enclosed backyard. Sometimes, though, the puppy will be at my house when the boys are not home or have gone somewhere over night. My apartment is a block away from their's and is the second and third floor of a house. I have two roommates who are aware of my decision to raise a puppy and are on board to learn how to help me teach him good house manners and adhere to Guiding Eye training policies. Our landlords and the other tenants living below me and my boyfriend's apartments are also close friends and aware with and fine with us raising a puppy in our apartments. Both of our apartments are in Albany, and we do both have neighboring houses very close to the vicinity of ours. On some weekends, (about once every 6 weeks), we travel home to Long Island and have considered how this might affect us being able to raise a puppy. We have thought about and worked out a plan (according to the advice we have received from Guiding Eyes) to transport the puppy when we do this and for a place for the puppy to stay when we get there. My parents have agreed to let the puppy stay at my house while we are home and are excited to also take part in teaching him good house manners and socialization. While at my house on Long Island, I have a large enclosed yard which I hope to utilize to let the puppy have some free space to run and get active. My family does have another dog at home, however, this dog is a Shiba Inu and has been exposed to a number of other dogs coming to my house (cousin's dogs) without their ever being a problem. Our Shiba Inu always has to stay on a leash when outside due to their hunting nature and tendency to run. As for other weekends, when we are not traveling home. My boyfriend and I are pretty much always at his apartment or not very far. Our weekends are pretty low-key at this point and provide us with ample time to socialize the dog and get out to new places and settings. Finally, as far as upcoming events, we plan on traveling home to Long Island for our winter break which will be about 4 weeks in December. We have discussed with our RM possibly attending classes at the Guiding Eyes Center in NYC at this time, if this can be arranged, so that we do not miss out on classes. We would be more than willing to travel there to attend classes and are hoping this will work. If not though, we will work on arranging something to get back to the area for the nights that classes are held, or at least the majority of them (we may have to miss just one if that is the case). Other than that, we do plan on graduating in May and leaving the area to return home to Long Island. This may leave us only able to raise a puppy until May, however, depending on how things go and how much time we find needed to raise the puppy and what kind of  feasible plan we are able to work out, we are considering the possibility of also keeping the puppy after May and transferring to the NYC Guiding Eyes Center, as we recently have been told we may be able to do.     We are, with the support of our roommates and families, excited to raise a puppy for Guiding Eyes! If you need any further information about our situation or I was unclear about anything, PLEASE let us know! Thank you so much for this opportunity!"

I am 16 years old, and I have three brothers. My oldest brother (Bruno) is 20 and works in Georgia, but he comes to visit regularly. My two other brothers are Pierre (14 years old) and RaphaÌÇl (11 years old). They go to St Matthew's Catholic school in Virginia Beach, and my mom drives takes/pick them there. I am a Junior (11th Grade) at Bishop Sullivan Catholic High School in Virginia Beach and I take the bus at Orchard Square.    Here is my schedule:    Every morning, my mom and I wake up at 5am. I will be taking care of the puppy from 5am to 6am (feeding, getting busy, playing outside, working to learn whatever we are supposed to teach it that week). At 6am, my mom wakes up my two younger brothers. She will take care of the puppy, while we all get ready for school.    We leave the house at 7:50am. We will take the puppy with us to the bus stop. Then, my mom takes my brothers to school. At 7:50am, she will drop off the puppy back at home in its crate while she goes to work until 11am. Then, she comes home from 11am to 1pm and will care for the puppy then. She goes back to work until 4pm. She works 3.17 miles from home, so she is close enough to go back and forth when needed. At 4:00pm, she'll go to pick up the puppy, and take it with her to get my brothers at their school, then, me at the bus stop. The bus usually drops me at around 4pm in front of the Farm Fresh, but I wait inside the store in the Starbuck section, and do my homework there until my mom comes (by 4:50pm usually). Most of the times, I have finished my homework by the time she picks me up. Then, we go home, and mom cooks dinner. I will take the puppy outside, feed it, etc... from 5:00pm to 6:00pm, which is when dinner is usually ready. Pierre also finishes his homework during the after-school CARE (from 3pm to 4:30pm) while waiting for my mom. RaphaÌÇl, because of his disease, has a little brain damage, so he is never finished with homework during the after-school CARE, but he finishes it while mom cooks dinner. Pierre and I can take turns caring for the puppy until dinner.    On Monday evening: We go to our weekly Puppy Raiser meeting from 7pm to 9pm. So, we leave home at 6:30pm. The puppy will come with us to these meetings. Then, when we get home, I'll take my shower first, so that I can walk the puppy while my brothers take theirs. RaphaÌÇl goes to bed at 8pm, Pierre at 8:30pm, I go at around 9pm, and mom goes soon after us, unless she has work to do. (She is currently translating a book for a French author, so sometimes, she works on it while everyone sleeps). Puppy will go to bed at 9pm, when I take it to its crate for the night.    On Tuesday evenings, we don't do anything, so we can be home with the puppy. During Baseball seasons, Pierre and RaphaÌÇl usually have games or practices on that night. but I stay home, and can care for the puppy.     On Wednesday evenings: RaphaÌÇl and I go fencing at Virginia Wesleyan College from 7:30pm to 9:00pm. Mom takes us there and stays there at the Food Court while we practice. She will be taking the puppy with us, so that she can walk and work with it outside in the parking lot while we practice fencing.    On Thursday evenings: Mom has a photography club meeting from 7pm to 9pm, that she goes to on the 1st and 3rd Thursday of each month. On weeks that she doesn't have the meeting, she stays with us at home.    On Fridays, I do fencing with my school's club at Bishop Sullivan, so mom comes with my brothers to pick me up there. On Fridays, mom works until noon only, and she is 'free' in the afternoons. So, she'll be home caring for the puppy, and taking it with her to get my brothers, then, they'll come to pick me up after fencing. Usually, she stays in the parking lot and watches us practice outside. The puppy will be able to watch us too.    On Saturday mornings, mom teaches a French Class at ODU in Norfolk, but she gets home by 1pm. I will be home to care for the puppy while she teaches. On the 1st and the 3rd Saturday of the month, Pierre, RaphaÌÇl and I have Altar Boys practice at church from 10am to noon. So, on these days, puppy will go to ODU in the classroom with mom. Puppy will do whatever we are doing on Saturday afternoons. Mom usually tries, once a month to take us somewhere (like in Greenville, SC, to go to walk in the mountains...).    On Sundays, we go to mass (church) from 10:30am to noon. The puppy will stay home. Church is also less than 3 miles from home, so, mom asked Father if we could bring the puppy to church once it is old enough to behave. Father is all right with it. So, the first few months, puppy will stay home while we go to church, but once it starts behaving well enough, we'll start taking it to church with us.    Sunday afternoon, RaphaÌÇl and I go to a Pokemon Cards club. For the first few months, puppy will stay with mom at home (or wherever she goes when she takes her long walks outside), then, later on, I plan on taking the puppy with me there (when he can stay a couple of hours in one spot, behaving). On Sunday afternoons, Pierre is always outside playing football with his friends, so mom may take it to watch the boys play."

Pierre and I can take turns caring for the puppy until dinner.    On Monday evening: We go to our weekly Puppy Raiser meeting from 7pm to 9pm. So, we leave home at 6:30pm. The puppy will come with us to these meetings. Then, when we get home, I'll take my shower first, so that I can walk the puppy while my brothers take theirs. RaphaÌÇl goes to bed at 8pm, Pierre at 8:30pm, I go at around 9pm, and mom goes soon after us, unless she has work to do. (She is currently translating a book for a French author, so sometimes, she works on it while everyone sleeps). Puppy will go to bed at 9pm, when I take it to its crate for the night.    On Tuesday evenings, we don't do anything, so we can be home with the puppy. During Baseball seasons, Pierre and RaphaÌÇl usually have games or practices on that night. but I stay home, and can care for the puppy.     On Wednesday evenings: RaphaÌÇl and I go fencing at Virginia Wesleyan College from 7:30pm to 9:00pm. Mom takes us there and stays there at the Food Court while we practice. She will be taking the puppy with us, so that she can walk and work with it outside in the parking lot while we practice fencing.    On Thursday evenings: Mom has a photography club meeting from 7pm to 9pm, that she goes to on the 1st and 3rd Thursday of each month. On weeks that she doesn't have the meeting, she stays with us at home.    On Fridays, I do fencing with my school's club at Bishop Sullivan, so mom comes with my brothers to pick me up there. On Fridays, mom works until noon only, and she is 'free' in the afternoons. So, she'll be home caring for the puppy, and taking it with her to get my brothers, then, they'll come to pick me up after fencing. Usually, she stays in the parking lot and watches us practice outside. The puppy will be able to watch us too.    On Saturday mornings, mom teaches a French Class at ODU in Norfolk, but she gets home by 1pm. I will be home to care for the puppy while she teaches. On the 1st and the 3rd Saturday of the month, Pierre, RaphaÌÇl and I have Altar Boys practice at church from 10am to noon. So, on these days, puppy will go to ODU in the classroom with mom. Puppy will do whatever we are doing on Saturday afternoons. Mom usually tries, once a month to take us somewhere (like in Greenville, SC, to go to walk in the mountains...).    On Sundays, we go to mass (church) from 10:30am to noon. The puppy will stay home. Church is also less than 3 miles from home, so, mom asked Father if we could bring the puppy to church once it is old enough to behave. Father is all right with it. So, the first few months, puppy will stay home while we go to church, but once it starts behaving well enough, we'll start taking it to church with us.    Sunday afternoon, RaphaÌÇl and I go to a Pokemon Cards club. For the first few months, puppy will stay with mom at home (or wherever she goes when she takes her long walks outside), then, later on, I plan on taking the puppy with me there (when he can stay a couple of hours in one spot, behaving). On Sunday afternoons, Pierre is always outside playing football with his friends, so mom may take it to watch the boys play."

I am 16 years old, and I have three brothers. My oldest brother (Bruno) is 20 and works in Georgia, but he comes to visit regularly. My two other brothers are Pierre (14 years old) and RaphaÌÇl (11 years old). They go to St Matthew's Catholic school in Virginia Beach, and my mom drives takes/pick them there.

On weeks that she doesn't have the meeting, she stays with us at home.    On Fridays, I do fencing with my school's club at Bishop Sullivan, so mom comes with my brothers to pick me up there. On Fridays, mom works until noon only, and she is 'free' in the afternoons. So, she'll be home caring for the puppy, and taking it with her to get my brothers, then, they'll come to pick me up after fencing. Usually, she stays in the parking lot and watches us practice outside. The puppy will be able to watch us too.    On Saturday mornings, mom teaches a French Class at ODU in Norfolk, but she gets home by 1pm. I will be home to care for the puppy while she teaches. On the 1st and the 3rd Saturday of the month, Pierre, RaphaÌÇl and I have Altar Boys practice at church from 10am to noon. So, on these days, puppy will go to ODU in the classroom with mom. Puppy will do whatever we are doing on Saturday afternoons. Mom usually tries, once a month to take us somewhere (like in Greenville, SC, to go to walk in the mountains...).    On Sundays, we go to mass (church) from 10:30am to noon. The puppy will stay home. Church is also less than 3 miles from home, so, mom asked Father if we could bring the puppy to church once it is old enough to behave. Father is all right with it. So, the first few months, puppy will stay home while we go to church, but once it starts behaving well enough, we'll start taking it to church with us.    Sunday afternoon, RaphaÌÇl and I go to a Pokemon Cards club. For the first few months, puppy will stay with mom at home (or wherever she goes when she takes her long walks outside), then, later on, I plan on taking the puppy with me there (when he can stay a couple of hours in one spot, behaving). On Sunday afternoons, Pierre is always outside playing football with his friends, so mom may take it to watch the boys play."

From New Jersey I am commuting everyday to a 10 week program Internship in New York City down by the World Trade Center. My job is 9-5 with an hour lunch break. When I arrive home around 630 I normally cook myself some dinner and relax at home for the rest of the night or go out to meet friends. When I receive my puppy, however, I will be already moved into my new house at my college, Marist in Poughkeepsie NY. I have my own room and everyone who is in my house (5 girls) is excited and anxious to meet the new puppy and help in any way they can with the process of becoming a Guide Dog. I scheduled my classes purposely in anticipation for my puppy needing a lot of my attention. I scheduled 930 AM classes so that I will have time to tend to my puppy in the morning, and then 2:00 and 3:30 classes so I have time for lunch and play time. When I am not at class I am on the executive board of the largest social group on Campus called Campus Ministry. We every last Sunday and first Monday of the month for meetings in addition to any extra fundraissing events we do on campus for local food shelters or homeless shelters. I have received the approval of my campus to allow my dog to come with me to classes and anywhere else I may need to get to (pending the pup is ready for those experiences and what the Guiding Eyes deems as acceptable places for him to be). I also am the President of Fox P.A.W.S (People for Animal Welfare Society) and this will have monthly meetings on Wednesday nights as well. On a more day to day business, after my classes (the times I have posted above are the same Monday-Thursday I have a 3 day weekend) I normally will make myself dinner at home around 530-6 and then hang out around the house or take a walk on campus down by the river. I normally go to bed around 1130-12 depending on the amount of homework I have. I have been waiting in anticipation for this puppy for so long. Everyone on my campus, including the administration, is aware that this is going to happen and are fully supportive of anything that I need or Guiding Eyes may want of them.
