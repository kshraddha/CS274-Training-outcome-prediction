Labrador Retriever,Yellow,F,MD,Yes,Nutro Puppy,"walks, training, actively plays with other dogs outside at home, interacts with family members with ball or tug toy","Jess is a very adventurous and bold puppy.  She is smart and learns quickly.  However, she can also be stubborn and have her own agenda.  She needs high interest treats when working outside with distractions.  Her new habit (last five days) of barking has become problematic at work and in the house, so we need guidance on that.  Jess is very in tune to her people and loves to get praise and attention, sometimes that is more motivating to her than food.  She has lots of energy so finding appropriate ways for her to release that is a challenge.  Jess's personality and energy make her a great candidate for a guide dog, she just needs LOTS of practice and some maturing. ",0

She is not overly bold, but is very confident once she's found her center and calms herself quickly when encountering new experiences.

When food is too much of a distraction she's done very well with verbal praise, physical contact and my body language as alternative rewards.

In more casual settings she (I?) is/am more easily distracted. I mentioned cat issues. My 'less friendly' cat sometimes hisses/growls when Gladys enters a room, which intrigues Gladys who wants to investigate. If the cat runs, Gladys may get excited and give chase. I'm usually able to anticipate, so it doesn't happen often. Then a couple nights ago Gladys laid calmly within a few feet while the cat came to me for attention, but its not a pattern of behavior I can count on yet. Gladys is friendly toward my other cat and learning to respect her space. Same with my personal dog.Gladys has improved when approaching stangers, and when she does get excited is more easily redirected.

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,F,MD,Yes,None. Still on bland diet.,Walking,"Overall, Emily is fun to be around and she is a really smart dog and a quick learner. The biggest issue is her inability to calm herself down when she gets excited or frustrated. She gets herself into a frenzy and you can tell she has no control. I've tried increasing the distance and distracting her, but all that seems to do is make it worse.  I've tried standing still and also trying to get her to walk in a different direction which doesn't seem to work either.  She becomes a growling, biting, run around out of control mess. I have to pick her up and put her in her kennel. This is fine if we are in the house, but when we are outside and I have to carry her 2 or 3 blocks to get home it becomes a problem.  She seems to come unhinged and she becomes what we call ""hair on fire crazy"".  We aren't quite sure what sets her off either. One time she became unhinged because she wanted to eat an acorn and I wouldn't let her. So, I had to pick her up and carry her the three blocks home because she wasn't listening. Every time I put her down I could tell she still wasn't in control of herself. Another time, the situation was pretty exciting - she saw a rushing creek for the first time so it was fast movement, loud noise, and water!  She wasn't sure about it at first so she kept running up to it and then running away. Each time she would get closer and not run away as far. She finally figured out it was water and she was thrilled to death and at the same time became unhinged. I ended up having to carry her the quarter of a mile home because, again, each time I put her on the ground she exhibited the same out of control behavior.  She bolts in every direction, growls, and bites at my clothes. Evidently three blocks away from an acorn or a quarter of a mile away from a creek is not enough distance to allow her to calm herself. Loud noises and different surfaces underfoot do not seem to be a problem at this time. She walks on concrete, grass, gravel, tar and chipped roads, dirt roads, paving blocks, and paved surfaces without a problem.  The only noise I remember startling her was the fire trucks briefly testing their siren and horn one morning. We were about three blocks away from the fire station when, for about a second, they turned on the siren and honked their horn. Emily was startled by that and stood there for a second or two and then she was fine.  We continued on our walk as if nothing had happened. This was the first time she had ever heard that noise. The diarrhea has been a huge issue and I think it has also somewhat impacted her training a little since I was afraid to give her too many treats and when we are rushing to get her outside so she doesn't have an accident in the house, the last thing I am thinking about is proper manners and walking appropriately on lead. I'm hoping that once we get her GI issues straightened out we can get better at the training. I do think her behavior, when she is in class, has improved over the past few weeks. She doesn't seem to be as restless as she was in the beginning and she seems relatively calmer around the other dogs as long as they keep their distance. She still needs to improve a lot, but I think I see a difference in her as the weeks go by.  Tiny improvements each time we attend class. Grant it, to an outsider she probably still looks like a wild woman, but to me, I can tell she is a bit better than she was about paying attention to me and while she still gets distracted, she seems to be able to recover herself a little bit quicker each time.",0

Jude will urinate in his kennel within 30 minutes of having been allowed to get busy and has indoor accidents when he gets excited. He seems very immature and highly distracted around getting busy. As a result, we do not consider him housebroken at 5 months. He did very well on his puppy sits and accompanied his two puppy sit handlers to work where they reported that he settled nicely and did not have accidents while with them at work but they also took him out frequently and never left him alone. They also reported that he barked a lot when put in his kennel in their homes (keeping one poor couple up at night) and that he had accidents at home which improved over time (both sitters had no other dogs in the home). We have learned that he cannot concentrate on getting busy unless on leash and away from the other older dogs. Despite being kenneled within two feet and in sight of the other dogs in their kennels, he barks every time he is kenneled. While he settles down after a while (receiving rewards and treats when quiet) he still has accidents. This has been a time suck for us (regular cleaning and deoderizing of the kennel tray) and has made us rather distrust him in the house (we have taken up some rugs to avoid soiling). Despite being taken out very frequently (sometimes about every hour if he has been playing or waking from sleep), he still has accidents. He will not be allowed to work indoors for another month at least.Jude returned last week at puppy class from his last sit highly distracted and pulling badly on leash although the sitters said he had been easy to handle. It took half the class to get his attention, and even then he was highly distracted by smells. Due to his being bitten by a copperhead this weekend, the raiser had to keep his leash time to a minimum and has not had much opportunity to refresh his leash manners.While we were once resolved to return him to GEB, we have decided that his sweet temperament; ability to settle calmly when alone and undistracted; and willingness to work trump the frustration of his extremely unreliable habits of elimination. We will also overlook our disappointment that like Omaha he seems cow-hocked and unlikely to be considered for stud even if we were to ensure he made his IFT. You know, having raised two broods, we'd really like to have a stud or two and some more grandpuppies to raise ...

Fetch, swimming, tug, playing outside, small walks","Iva is a smart puppy and her attention has really improved over the past few weeks. She's walking better on leash and really likes to check things out, walk on different surfaces., etc. She knows Sit, Down, Stand, Heel. We are working on Close and Over.   I think the hardest thing for her will be ignoring people and eventually greeting politely. We have not been saying hi to anyone unless I know them and we can practice nicely. I pay her really well for checking in with me and holding a command with people around. We have done a lot of people watching and practicing in low key places.   Iva is very busy. She jumps from one toy to another and plays and plays. However, if she gets the scoots you know she is done and needs a nap. She's great in her crate. She is definitely a pup that will become activated if overwhelmed or excited.  She doesn't seem to have issues with body handling or wearing things. She's good and less excited around other dogs. ",0
Labrador Retriever,Black,F,MA,Yes,Science Diet,"Fetch, walking, tug, swimming when warmer","Iva is doing well. I can definitely see improvement with her excitement around people. She does well walking past people and ignoring them, but if they come up to pet her suddenly she sometimes loses her self control. Also, if you are talking to someone she might try to sneak in a hello. If they use a squeaky voice we are done for, and I move her away. She still licks a lot!! Iva still acts very much like a puppy, but you can tell she is trying hard to focus and control herself. We have had some really great greetings where I'm able to get her to sit while someone pet her, but generally when we are out I have not been allowing her to say hi. She plays great with other dogs, and the cat is her buddy. She is very good about respecting the cat's space and things. She still stalks her toys and sometimes the other dogs. Iva absolutely loves her crate and will go in voluntarily to nap or chew a toy. She is very good at settling when out and does not need a toy. She is good about getting a toy and occupying herself at home. She walks great almost all the time and is enjoyable to take for longline walks, as well. Her body handling is coming along well. She doesn't have a problem wearing things. She also really enjoys climbing and exploring different things. Iva's biggest problem area is her self control around strangers.",0

Demand barking is the most challenging thing we are dealing with, particularly around our pet labs when they don't want to play with her in the house.  The only way we are successful is to have them physically apart for most of the day.  She is one of those pups that is both pushy/demanding and also build-up in terms of her confidence.  She is easily bored and does best when she has had a lot of physical or mental exercise.  She did well on our trip south last week and had a wide variety of environments to work, settle and play in -- including very noisy/busy environment in Savannah, GA and beach sand and waves on Pawley's Island, SC -- and lots of restaurants, museums, shuttle buses, street cars, etc!

Fully eliminating on command. She sometimes will wait to ""get busy"" on walks after having the chance to go prior.  2. Staying calm and in the think and learn zone when around other dogs. Fauna becomes extremely excited when she sees other dogs which causes her to lose focus and stop responding to commands. This can happen in class as well as any dog that we pass on walks. Will ""say hi"" over-eagerly by showering the other dog with kisses and play. Does check in periodically, but will try to re-initiate play often.  Fauna is extremely confident and eager to learn every day. She enjoys her training sessions, being body handled and is very sweet and affectionate in nature.

She responds well both to giving her time to observe and to head turns. She loves to be treated for check-ins!

The biggest excitement we deal with right now is greeting people calmly, some pulling when we go to a new place, and outings that involve other dogs.

But we can usually have food at his eye level and he is not interested in taking it and is great in restaurants and has been good at the other home on a swap. One thing to note- if he can see his reflection in a window (not a mirror) he sometimes barks at it. It will have to be when he is staring for a good while not when he passes by it on a walk. I think this is because he thinks the other dog is staring and perceives it as a challenge even though he is looking at himself. He is great everywhere and a nice companion with good initiative.",0

German Shepherd,Black/tan,M,NY,Yes,Science Diet,Walking / running free in fenced in yard/,"Hadley showed some problems with confidence initially.   Also was not real good with body handling. When handling his hind quarters he would grab hands with mouth. We have worked on these and he continues to  gain confidence. He has improved with body handling  and allows us to pick him up, handle him, trim nails, etc.   He was very excited when I got him out of the kennel.  He is more reactive when I take him out VS Patti.  This excitement is reducing with training.  He settles very well in the house. I have him with me at my office daily, and he settles exceptionally well.  Greets and interacts extremely well with many different employees.  Exposure to new noises, environment without any noted concerns thus far.   On the third day we had him he strained his front foot when he came down on the side of the kennel and displayed limping for a week. My vet checked him out and nothing broken etc.  Basically rested him for a week. Minimal activity. This resolved itself but I have not allowed him to jump up or down getting into cars, or other similar elevations.  So besides his physical size as a pup, and my concern for impact on him from elevations, we are still picking him up to put into the car.    He is good on various under footings, wire, plastic, stones, sewer grates.  He gets along with our family dogs, we have overcome initial interaction problems, and there are still some times he needs a reminder, but overall his interactions are age appropriate.   He is influenced by his surroundings but is starting to gain focus, but it will obviously take more work.  Rides very well in the car, stays very quiet, is relaxed and can be by himself without fussing.      It is interesting that he gets so excited when I take him out of the crate, but does not get excited when I leave his presence in the car, or in the house.     His excitement level is reducing when exiting crate, and he regains his normal self far quicker than our first weeks.  Rides very well in car, settles , sleeps more of the time, is relaxed. No concerns if we leave him in car alone for various lengths of time.   Sleeps overnight in kennel, without fussing.  He is intelligent and well natured.     ",0

Ann is still in process of doing sitter report.  Hadley is learning very fast and we are seeing some very nice traits as he develops.  Loves to fetch, good energy.  Excellent in public.  Last weekend had him in a Starbucks for first time, and he remained in a down stay for 15 minutes without any problems. Does good in shopping malls, I have been increasing his exposure to people/distractions by taking him into mall at busy times.  He usually observes other dogs on walks without barking at them. Took him for his first bath at the Car/Dog wash facility and he did excellent.   He is gaining confidence as he matures.  Very nice personality, very interactive with family and numerous visitors to our residence.     During class after initial excitement he calms right down and can interact in class and normally not distracted by his k9 classmates.    Very healthy.  Duration is increasing, working hard on this.

German Shepherd,Black/tan,M,NY,Yes,Science Diet,Walks/ Free run in back yard and enclosed garage,"Hadley is a very nice pup.  Excellent demeanor in the house. At GEB classes he gets excited upon first coming in but settles in shorter amount of time as he matures.  At the Christmas class did a drill which students and dogs made two lines, he did a down stay and of leash recall to me in solid form.  He remained focused and obeyed without deviance.   The efforts of the members of the Fingerlakes group for various classes / training settings are of great value and benefit to the pups. Does very well in various outings.  I have had him in many malls, stores, etc. Recently he was invited into the United Health Services Emergency Room, where we were in amongst the exam rooms.  He did excellent, many distractions, active movement of people, equipment, stretchers, many new noises.  Many people greetings. We have been asked to return as often as we can.  He does very well with greetings of people of all ages, including many very young toddlers. He now barks at times while inside crate in the car, I think its age related,  buts he like to ride in car.  Will now jump into the car and into his kennel without any problem.  Over the holidays had many people in the house and he was very good interacting with them.  He has great spirit energy and is a happy pup.  Follows us around the house and keeps track of where we are or are going in the house.The halti has been of great benefit in compliance and requires less physical effort to control pulling, barking.   I have been using the halti with less frequency but still use it when I anticipate encountering another dog, or barking situation.  ",0

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,F,NY,Yes,Iams proactive health- smart puppy large breed,Backyard running and ball fetching,"Dania has made great progress in learning new skills since her last Walk & Talk.  Dania is a very happy dog who loves people and other animals. She has always loved her kennel and is a great napper & all-night-long sleeper, even sleeping through thunderstorms.  Dania no longer inappropriately chews on household items (other than socks.)  She also travels well and settles down immediately in her crate. [We have not practiced Dania riding in the front passenger seat to date.]  When in a learning zone, she follows all commands.  Dania & her raisers, still need to work on social skills, specifically when meeting & greeting new people at home or out and about.  We also need to work on lead pulling.*  When Dania gets close to new people or when picking up scents, Dania will repeatedly pull, but will eventually settle back into a listening zone.*Dania has adapted to wearing the muzzle while eating meals.  We have not progressed to actually having Dania wear it while walking on a lead.",0
Labrador Retriever,Yellow,F,NY,Yes,IAMS,"Playing, chasing balls, toys, walks","Dania is very playful and loving.  When in the 'zone of learning,' Dania has the ability to master most skills.  However, we feel that we, as her raisers, have not been as consistent as possible in practicing certain skills with Dania.  First, due to the extreme cold conditions this winter, walking Dania to her 'Get Busy' area was very expedited and Dania often pulled on her leash to get back inside the house - which we allowed due to weather conditions.  Secondly, Dania loves to scavenge outside and is continually searching for leaves, twigs, pebbles, etc. anything on the ground.  She has been improving in both of these areas because we have been diligently practicing improving these skills (leash pulling and scavenging.)  Thirdly, Dania loves to chew & gnaw on inappropriate things such as people, furniture, and house fixtures.  We must keep a steady vigil on Dania at all times and cannot leave her unattended.  We recognize these concerns and are truly making a concerted effort to address them by being consistent in practicing these skills with Dania.  Thank you for your continued support.",0

Labrador Retriever,Black,M,NC,Yes,Iams Puppy (yellow bag),"walks, play","Binzel is good with obedience skills; my primary concern has been house manners and home stuff.   1.  On body handling, I can maneuver him into position and touch spots.  However I have been having trouble drying him with towels (mouths the towels and starts to play) and recently nail clipping (mouths the clipper / tries to play).  We have gone back to the first steps on nail clipping.  2.  When Binzel arrived he mouthed everything and we have been working on that by leaving out canned stuff and other things as well as appropriate toys, rewarding for choosing the right toys and ignoring stuff.  He has improved in this regard, but when he lapses he mouths specific places on walls and mouldings or grabs tissues/socks/handkerchieves/shoes.

Labrador Retriever,Black,F,NY,Yes,Iams Lamb and Rice,"walking, tug, sometimes fetch","-Yahtzee is still sometimes slow at processing her environment.  She's much better after going to a place once though!  She's slow to respond to commands and isn't the most driven dog- whoever is handling her has to be a cheerleader.  I know some dogs are calmer because their raisers are chill but she's the result of me trying to make her an active, responsive dog and she's still lazy and slow-thinking (but I've come to really love it!).  She's not much of a tester though so when she's slow to respond it's because she's distracted or because she's thinking through everything.  She's very dog distracted (stares or pulls towards dogs, doesn't bark though) and can watch a dog walk down the street for a long time before offering a check in- I've started asking her for them sooner but if she gives me the check in it's a very quick one and she refuses to take treats.  -She seems more distracted by things (people walking, sounds) at night/in the dark and takes a longer time to check in/re-focus....I'm not sure if that's normal and I just didn't notice it with Aurora? -She had a fear of grated under footings right before going into heat and was still a bit weary of them after heat.  We've worked a lot on it and she's much better, but you can tell it's something that's been worked on and if she's stressed she really has to be encouraged to go over them.  -She randomly stops walking sometimes and just stands there- I think it's usually when we're in places she knows but doesn't feel like going?  Although I'm not completely sure.  I usually just verbally encourage her to keep going and she does-Yahtzee is very low key and her absolute favorite activity is doing nothing with me :P  She loves snuggling on her terms and is so sweeeet about everything.  She's not persistent about things-once you tell her she can't have/do something she just moves on.",0

He is a laid back, easy going dog that stops and thinks before jumping into a situation. He leans quickly and retinas it. He is friendly to everyone and everything he meets. Having a dog already, has been a blessing and a curse for Wrigley. A blessing in that Wrigley has learned how to get along with other animals and has ample daily exercise. But a curse as my dog has taught him some bad house manners which we are working to improve. I can't tell you what a joy it is to have Wrigley a part of our family and how honored my family is to be a part of this organization. As I learn better ways of training him, he learns to be a a better behaved dog.  I am grateful to the Nashua group which meets every Sunday (when there hasn't been snow!). Everyone has been so helpful and supportive. ",0
Labrador Retriever,Yellow,M,NH,Yes,Blue Wilderness,"Because of his broken toe, he has been limited in physical exercise. He does more slow, short walks and lots of Kongs.","He doesn't seem to generalize well. He doesn't always seem to carry his ""good"" habits to the puppy sits.His house manners are fine, but not the skills we've been working on, such as pulling and crate tolerance. Although at home, he will go in by himself just to relax.  He has learned to calm down a lot. It takes him about 10 to 15 minutes at an outing to get his bearings and figure out what is expected of him. If we go in to a building, go out, and come back in, he does much better the second time. I usually find that he has to ""get busy"" shortly after arriving at a new location. Our outings have been very limited for the past 6 weeks due to his cast. We have not be into any public buildings until yesterday when we went to Pet Smart. I am hoping to get a clean bill of health from the vet next week so we can start visiting places again.",0
Labrador Retriever,Yellow,M,NH,Yes,Blue Wilderness,"Walking, playing with a toy","Wrigley has come a long way. He is excellent when he is ""on,"" especially in stores, restaurants, and other social events like parades or Christmas tree lightings, etc. I will sometimes go into a place and if he isn't ""there"" yet, will walk out and back and he then gets it. If there is another dog present, however, he seems to forget that I am there. But we have been working on this with Kerry. He now can sit at the bus stop when our neighbor walks by with his dog and will ignore him. All in all, Wrigley knows exactly what he is suppose to do. He is very smart. But there are times when he ""pretends"" not hear. He is getting better. Even if he does break away, say, and goes to visit another dog, he will say hi and comes back to me before I go get him. He used to totally choose to ignore me (or the person with the leash). Wrigley LOVES to play and be around other dogs and people who will play with him. Like I said before, he is an opportunist and will take advantage if it suits him. My one concern, unrelated to this survey, is his fearlessness. He seems to have no sense of danger or caution, especially around cars, and will plunge headlong into any situation if not restrained.",0

She stays fairly attentive to me, but wants to be entertained.  I generally bring a chew/bone with me so that she can focus on that and chew out any anxieties that she has.   Car riding is MUCH improved.  She recently starting loading on her own without treats, tori or us to lure her in.  I still heavily treat her with a carrot or a nice chew in the car.  Yesterday she traveled all the way to Cape Charles (1 hour) without any vomiting/salivating.  She did bark on the bridges.  Don't know if there was a difference in the sound the car was making or if she didn't understand why we were high above the water.  I was driving so couldn't really watch and figure it out.  The back seat is her preferred place to ride.  When greeting people when we are out she is usually fairly good.  Sometimes she'll try to jump but tends to be very well mannered.  At home it is a different story.  When she is excited she barks/sings and will jump repeatedly.  We have tried blocking her so she can't get at the person, we have tried blocking her with our knees she she jumps to deflect her.  We have tried holding her in a sit until she calms.  The holding her in a sit seems to be somewhat effective.  But there has not been any real improvement here.  She is highly, HIGHLY athletic and jumping is part of her expression of exuberance.  When out playing and given the chance to really run, she tends to bounce initially before she ""settles"" into that very streamlined graceful run that GSDs have.  We see a lot of bounce in her play with Tori.  Oksana is a fearless dog in a lot of ways.  It really doesn't occur to her to have issues with underfootings, heights etc.  She is incredibly intelligent and exuberant about most of what she encounters.  There is a silliness to her personality which is quite endearing (But in a refined GSD kind of way, not silly they way you see it in a lab).  And she wants to express everything she is seeing/feeling.  So we get a lot of alert barks about the world around us/her.  She will bark at Tori incessantly if Tori is playing with (or more likely cuddling with) a toy she wants.  When first let out of her crate int he morning or when we have been out there is a lot of squealing.  Its double the fun with both her and Tori are excited and fussing.  Her personality is quite lovely, but really her biggest issues are the (at times) incessant barking, the jumping and the play biting.

Sometimes he will hump a male dog during play (finds 1 in a group and focuses on him)Still very distracted by dogs and takes a long time to focus back on me even with direction and distance.  He will stare and remain locked when trying to go the other way.  He will whine and may let out 1 or 2 barks out of excitement when we are not greeting the dog.Yolo is better at going down stairs but is still working on going up stairs at a slow and even pace.  Sometimes if I say ""good boy"" while he is walking nicely on the stairs he will stop and look for a treat.Yolo seems confident in new situations and is willing to work. Very good in the car and settling when I am around. Working on the separation because he will look for me or whines. Yolo still itches and rubs his chin at least 2 times a day (rubs with paws and on objects that are the height of his chin). We thought it was his gums were hurting when he was teething or his chin ache but it is now a routine behavior for him.Was hoping to do another puppy swap but Yolo has a puppy sit in the next 2 weeks.",0

I have truly enjoyed working with her and I hope she will be successful at her IFT.  At this point I think her house manners are very good, she has an excellent temperment and is almost always calm and well behaved in the house.  I trust her to behave with the exception of dirty socks in the laundry room, which continue to be an issue about once every few weeks and assume she is finding them by smell. Since she is my first dog and we have been learning together, I try not to compare her with other dogs in the program but from what I have observed I worry about the following issues for her training:  1.  Does not always come when called in the yard because she is having too much fun running around. 2.  Overly excited about other dogs.  3.  Overly excited greeting people. 4.  Often gets distracted on walks by smells, dogs, people, sounds etc. but depends on the situation.  Hopefully we will continue to work on these issues over the next few months and she will continue to improve.",0

If he isn't able to get some energy out, he gets very hard to work with (inattentive, urge to run around, occasional chewing of his leash - obvious signs of stress). We try our best to let him play or run before going on walks to avoid this behavior. Recently, however, he has been getting stressed much more easily.

I find his settling at home is awesome.  His barking at our dog has pretty much stopped and if he does bark a ""uh oh"" is all he needs as a reminder.  Our meeting and playing with a 2 and 5 year old went really well with supervision, so he wouldn't get too excited we asked a lot of the kids not to run and scream.  He visits a nursing home every week and is very comfortable there.  The ladies even saw a great improvement.  We play with 2 pups weekly in the program and it is always positive, we even get a pack walk in and for the most part it isn't too sloppy.  My biggest concern is Verns excitement when he sees people.  That is our main focus at the moment and we are looking forward to our W & T and hopefully some more improvements.  ",0

I think the world can be overwhelming for him at times, but it can be difficult to recognize this immediately because he is very inhibited. Consequently, from a management perspective he does very well and often looks like he is doing fine when he is actually checked out or exiting the think and learn zone. I am constantly walking a fine line between not letting him get away with being lazy, but also not pushing him too hard and causing him to check out. I think he has difficulty regulating his stress, and consequently doesn't show any initiative. He is constantly looking to me for the answers. On the bright side, he is a super smart dog and a fast learner. He is also great practice for me in terms of reading dog body language because he is very hard to read. Overall, I think he is a very soft dog who needs a ton of support. I make it worth it for him to show motivation, but he is very inconsistent. My hope for him is that as he continues to get older, I can continue to help him work on his self-regulation and then maybe he will find the world more manageable.",0

(now, I have her eat in many different rooms and approach or touch her while she eats)  2.Left her alone in the house to shovel driveway. When I returned she was in her crate (door open) , but wouldn't come out until I said ""free"".",1

He shows independent thought and will do as asked once he feels comfortable. He can be a little impatient and self-release from sits, but redirects well.

Though I have not noticed this I work him in noisier settings. It might be residual to his Giardia.

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,M,VA,Yes,U.S. Grains Regal,"walk, pay with other dogs, play with my kids","Grant has never been a super confident puppy. He's always been a bit cautious, but would check things out in his own time. However, he's become scared of many sounds. For instance, he never minded the vacuum cleaner, but now he's spooked by it. I always make sure he has the opportunity to leave the room before I vacuum, and he always decides to leave. He may or may not check it out later when it's off and I leave it in the corner. A few days ago my son was playing with motorized hot wheel cars that run on a track. He heard the sound of the cars and ran out of the room into his crate. He's never been bothered by the cars before. We immediately turned it off and put it in a corner. My son has been playing with it when he's far away from Grant. Now Grant is not bothered by the toy at all and will walk next to it. He was troubled a few days ago when he heard the sound of aerosol stay can. W've been spaying it when he's far away from us, and he's clearly less disturbed. His reactions to noises are unpredictable. A heavy book recently fell close to his head, and he never even looked up (not bothered). He's not scared of traffic/construction noises. I think his fearfulness started when we were in a bathroom at a restaurant and a loud automatic hand dryer started. We left immediately. The sound of the dryer and air blowing profoundly affected him. He's an extremely calm dog, so it's easy to see when he's disturbed. He starts shaking, waging his tail, pulling his leash and whimpering. A few days after the blow dryer incident we went to a hospital to pick up medical records. He was fine at first and then became agitated. I still have no idea what spooked him (there was nothing obvious like a loud noise or unfamiliar object). Again, we left immediately. I haven't taken him into a building since that time. He stayed with an experienced raiser for 5 days, and she worked with him. She didn't find any specific triggers either. We've been hanging out in parking lots or shopping centers and walking in new places. He's great on those outings. At home we try to anticipate what will upset him and make sure he has the opportunity to leave the room.  He is generally good with under footings and will walk on most textures. He gets a little bothered if the under footing makes strange noises.   He can be indecisive. He understands basic commands and is compliant, but takes a few seconds to think through the process.   He's also a sensitive dog. He gets upset when we get upset (thin skinned). Therefore, we stay calm and never raise our voices. We give him tons of positive feedback.   His house manners are wonderful.   Anyhow, I'm trying to help him regain his confidence. He's a sweet dog with a great temperament.   ",0

We would play catch in our backyard on the long leashseveral times/week(now it's t","Secret has been very mellow since she started her Heat. She is such a joy to have around. She and Manny still get into squabbles together but are easily redirected with a toy. She did very well with our son and his family's visit over the Holidays which included a little puppy who liked to antagonize Secret and then jump up on the couch where she knew Secret would not go. By the end of the visit, the 2 of them would cuddle up in the same comfy bed on the floor and sleep: so cute!! Secret does have that issue of not wanting me to put the socks on her paws. She actually would run away from me and hide behind my husband's chair at one point. She now will let me touch her feet, but I'm proceeding very slowly in this. Secret likes to ""lead"" when I walk both Manny and her together, which leads me to believe she'd do a great job at leading a blind person. We are enjoying our time with Secret very much.

Labrador Retriever,Black,M,NY,Yes,Purina Pro Plan,"Walks, playing fetch","Leon is jealous of people interacting with me and will vie for my attention. He inserts himself between the other person and me, paws me, nudges, etc. On occasion he still barks at me for attention which is, at times, a legitimate signal that he needs to get busy. Other times it is purely seeking attention when my focus is elsewhere - like busy working at my desk.   He loves lap time, body handling and can be easily settled at home. He does not like body handling when he is out on a public exposure, at class or in other stressful environments. In these situations he will decompress if given opportunities for chewing or sniffing. His tolerance for public outings is improving slowly. A few minutes in a brand new place is still all he can handle before he's overwhelmed. When stressed his movements become faster and he is not able to maintain his focus or stay in a position without breaking. Gets stress dandruff, very heavy at times.  He's laying on my feet right now. Leon is a love bug who likes a lot of physical contact.",0

However, we are going to work on:  1. Getting in and out of car 2. Body handling 3. Not freeing himself from a command",1
Labrador Retriever,Black,M,CT,Yes,Blue Buffalo Puppy,puppy play and walks,"Grainger is doing great. There are only a few of things that I am really concerned about, one being hand biting of people. I know that he is still teething, but am trying my best to work on not allowing Grainger to use hands/arms as a way to relieve his tooth aches. The other big thing that I am mainly concerned about is his crate acceptance during the night. Grainger is great in his crate during the day (when I leave for class, eat dinner, etc), however, at night he will only sleep in the crate for about 2 hours and then will bark in the middle of the night. Lately he has been doing this every night, and I have mentioned this at our weekly classes. As recommended, I have tried taking Grainger out to GB and putting him right back in his crate (no play time, etc). Recently, when he barks during the night, I ignore him and he stops completely after about 5 minutes. At home, Grainger has a bigger crate and has no problem sleeping in it. I am trading his crate for a larger size for when we are at school, and will see if his nightly barking stops if he is in a bigger space.  The last thing that I have already made Kim aware in pup class is GraingerÆs demand barking. We have both seen a tremendous transformation in Grainger, for in the very beginning, he would constantly demand bark. We have come such a long way! Now, he only occasionally demand barks. For instance, I could be sitting on my bed or at my desk and he will sit below me and bark because he wants attention. This is only occasional, and we are working on eliminating it completely. ",1

Labrador Retriever,Black,F,MD,Yes,Iams Lamb & Rice,Walking and playing,"Gaila is doing very well.  We have seen her personality change and some behavior changes since the arrival of Felicia (retired GEB dog).  Her interest in other dogs has reduced (as we previously did not have a dog).  She is more confidendent, independent, and less reliant on human interaction, but does show an insistence on getting attention if Felicia is getting attention.  Her response has never been to growl, bite, or bark, but but rather to jump or push in.  (This seems to be reducing as time passes, and we are stern with such jumping/excited behavior.)   She has played hard with Felicia, and we have been strict with her about pulling ears and biting Felicia's legs during play.   Felicia's arrival has been positive for Gaila, but we have also had to adjust (and are continuing to adjust) as Gaila seems less less responsive to commands and less interested in ""listening"" to her humans. We continue to seek a ""balance"" with two dogs in our household, as well as learning to effectively respond to Gaila's new sense of independence and failure to listen.  (Her reduced willingness to follow commands and listen could also be due to her age - 9 months.)   The ""girls"" have settled in together, very well, and enjoy each other's company.  We have continued to maintain a strict regime - exercise, kennel, eating.  The additional exercise from playing with Felicia has increased food intake.  ",1

NO sniffing no blowing leaf chasing- only calmly sitting by my side.  We are working on that daily in familiar places to warm him up to the idea.   Odd note - Kojak is extremely ticklish- for lack of a better term- His leg goes when you scratch his jaw line and his back has 2 spots and his stomach and his front feet- when chewing an itch on his paws- his back leg goes nuts.,0

He also doesn't like to have his collar tight....at all.  He stops and scratches frequently when it is tight at all. It needs to be loose enough that it seems like he could slip it.   ",1

She loves to cuddle with our Golden Retriever; enjoys our ""cuddle"" sessions, and has settled nicely into our daily routine. ItÆs amazing how quiet she is in the kennel. The animals go to bed around 10:00 pm and I stay up to watch TV. Even though the TV is on and Monty is not in a kennel, Gwenyth settles in and does not complain.  Sometimes during our training sessions she requires time to process a command. If there are other animals nearby, she is easily distracted.  Gwenyth is very ""mouthy"" and wiggly in the morning just after getting out of the kennel. I usually have a toy for her to put into her mouth and that keeps her from putting my hands into her mouth. I've noticed that she often goes for a toy herself now, so that seems to be a step in the right direction. She enjoys going for walks. The rainy, icy, frigid weather has limited our time to work outside. When I drive her into town to practice walking at the strip malls, I find that there is so much salt spread on the sidewalks that I need to wash her feet when we return home.  Gwenyth enjoys riding in the car. We took her along to Pennsylvania over the weekend and she did very well in the motel.  I really enjoy having her! I worry that her sheer strength can bowl me over. IÆm counting on her love and trust in me to motivate her to focus on our training sessions so she learns how to think about what she's doing and make the right choices.  ",1

At times it has been very difficult to manage the diarrhea & some of his heath issues while working FT.  His health has certainly limited our ability to socialize him to an extent during his down times and if people get close to him, some do notice and question his lack of hair on his face.  On a positive note, he is a very loyal, smart, calm, fun & well mannered puppy.  He is a pleasure to be around and work with. ",0

Lately she has begun to ""test"" me when I ask certain behaviors (Kennel, Load up, Go Place) if she doesn't feel like obeying.  I am working through this with her by maintaining the hand gesture associated with the command and waiting for her to offer the behavior.  When she does, she gets rewarded enthusiastically.  If she continues to refuse (avoids eye contact, lays down with her back to me) and becomes distracted I try to re-engage her with other commands and then ask for the behavior again once she is re-connected.",1

He goes to classes with my three days a week for most of the day. He is getting very good at learning to walk past people without expecting to be petted no matter how close they are walking to us. He is also doing a great job on stairs, no matter the surface. I have taken him on multiple elevators and he is completely comfortable on them. Tiled floors are occasionally an issue for him but he is getting much better at it. He eats well and is extremely well behaved. Overall, no issues that won't be resolved within the next few weeks..",0

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,M,VA,Yes,Iams Lamb and Rice,Walks and Plays,I am not sure who is going to read this or if my comments are appropriate for this purpose.  This is my first GEB experience.  I love animals and I have always had them but never have structured their environment in this fashion.  I am learning alot with Ames.  I am certain he is a very smart dog.  I am certain he has a super personality.  He loves to please and he loves to be connected.  He is a lover.  He always has a smile on his face and he gives love constantly.  I have noticed that he loves the outdoors.  He would stay outside all day in any weather if you let him.  He also loves to work.  When we are in class he is very happy and he does not like to end that experience.  He knows when it is over and his body language will change and he gets a sad look on his face.  He also loves to smell things and he has a very keen sense of smell.  Sometimes he is more distracted by smells than by other animate objects.  If Ames makes it through this program I would like to say now - in case I don't get the chance to later - I think he will be happiest with a person who is very affectionate and who has a true love for him and will hug him and talk to him and pet him constantly. Ames is just a lover.  Sometimes he will go up to Clementine when she is sleeping and he will lay next to her and put his arm around her and sleep.  He does best when he is touching and being touched.  ,0

We can work a smell area until he starts ignoring it, but then when we encounter the next new thing, we have to go through the cycle again.

I bring high value treats and take her out for play breaks, but the intensity is a lot for her.  Her behavior upon seeing other dogs when we're out is dependent on the distance and the behavior of the other dog. She wants badly to greet and sniff, but if they get too close she barks loudly and continuously. If we can approach very gradually, with lots of time to settle between steps forward and lots of rewards for checkins, she can sometimes be successful. But if the other dog barks, she escalates immediately to red zone.  She is a very good girl at home most of the time, especially if she gets daily mental and physical exercise. She is smart, seems to like to please, and responds well to praise.",0

Labrador Retriever,Black,M,NY,Yes,Blue Adult,recreational walks/runs on 100' long line,"Declan is working diligently with me on self control, especially in the home environment.  He is unable to enter a home and behave appropriately on his own.  He is easily stimulated,  Introducing him to the home on a leash, asking him to earn the right to be without a leash is a must. We work on settle often.   Declan requires strict supervision while in the house and around other pups.  He instantly mounts other pups and is stimulated by any defensive behavior from other pups.  After 2-3 days of redirection on inappropriate behavior around other pups he can be trusted for 5-15 minutes unsupervised.  Declan walks well on a lead when there is little to no distraction but requires your anticipation to redirect and remain connected so as not to get dragged. Declan is often successful with short exposures.  Declan is willing and I think he wants to please!",1

He learns quickly and will try just about anything once, but will refuse to do things that he really doesn't like if he didn't like it the first time (jump off a pier, go through a long slippery play tunnel on the jungle gym - short ones are OK).   He seemed to take a little longer to mature than the other dogs we have raised and lose his attachment to his primary raiser. Now he can now be handled by other people, though still looks for me when separated, but no longer whines or looks distressed. Our class exercises made a huge difference.

He has always disliked having his paws touched, but allows us to wipe them before entering the house if we don't linger too long on a paw, otherwise he feints a bite. He writhes and howls if I attempt to clip his nails, and even with my husband holding him and feeding him treats, he still gets very upset. Luckily his nails do not grow very much (compared to our own dog Scout whose nails must be trimmed every week). A sitter touched his feet without issues, but the problem is if you linger on a foot for too long (say long enough to trim the nails). I feel rather defeated on this issue (I clip the nails on many of the dogs who stay with us and have had no problems - even when they are a little unsure at first. Only one other dog - a beagle/dachshund mix - had the same loud and boisterous reaction to having her feet touched for trimming and I gave up so as not to upset her too much).

At home, he doesn't beg or bark or chew or have accidents. He loves to learn and after just a few repetitions he has it down without the need for a lure.

He's easily excited around other animals, but surprisingly good with strangers (he's calm, quiet, cooperative and well-behaved in stores and at the vet). Class seems to be the most difficult time for Sidney. He's barked a few times, won't settle and doesn't respond to commands he knows inside and out in every other situation (at home and elsewhere). Last week, he also peed twice in class, which is difficult to understand given that he got busy right before class started, and again after the first accident about 20 minutes later.

There was a week in late Feb when he was so bad it was like he was a different dog. He was humping everything, destroying everything in sight, digging, barking, acting out and generally giving me his best Alpha impression.

And he goes because he can smell everything from there anyway. He has a fabulous nose. I put him in his crate in my room and then go out to the kitchen and open a jar of peanut butter and not two seconds later he is barking because he can smell it and he wants it. When we play hide and seek I don't call his name anymore because he smells something of mine and then he tracks me. I did not teach him that he taught himself that.  ,0

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,M,NC,Yes,Iams,"walks, toy play and appropriate dog play","I have some concerns with Knight as I feel that he is easily stressed. He demonstrates signs of stress even when walking down our street (which is a quiet neighborhood). We are careful where we take him to ensure quieter environments with short positive experiences which we repeat with similar variables (ie. time of day etc). His stress level seems to escalate quickly even when working in the same parking lots or our neighborhood and we are careful to end them before he enters the ""red zone"". I am concerned as he does not appear to become more comfortable in these repeated experiences. In the last month he has started to ""loose his brain"" while at home-puppy scooting which he has only done several times before (ie. last eval) when he has gotten too stressed. I have discussed concerns with Belvie and we have trialed giving him more kennel time throughout the day as well as play time alone with ""special toys"" (ie. skinzees and other toys that seem to provide him an outlet). These techniques have seemed to help his stress at home.  ",0

I am concerned as he does not appear to become more comfortable in these repeated experiences.

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,F,VA,Yes,iams puppy,"dog play, walks, hikes, fetch","Guava arrived Oct 27 (as of today Nov 23, 4 weeks).    I included notes from her previous raiser and RM Nicole as a baseline:    - Her name response is great!  - She has average energy and can get overwhelmed in too busy of an environment for her.  Raiser lives in a quieter area of Manhattan if that is possible and Guava does well there.  When there was a bike race in her familiar area she became overwhelmed and needed to take it slow.  - She is reported to have minor crating issues but the raiser lives in an apartment complex and has never had any complaints.   - She went to the beach on a long line and tended to pick on the younger shepherd that was with the group.  - She gets excited about people rather than dogs.  She can self modulate well but needs to work on greetings.   - There are two short videos of Guava playing with GEB pup Karat (11 wks old) and then GEB Mandrake (8 mos. Old).  Guava initially played well with Karat for about 5 minutes or so and then Guava started grabbing on KaratÆs neck, ears, etc and was being very rude. We separated the dogs but Guava kept going back at Karat.  I then had Guava play with an older dog (Mandrake) and they played very appropriately with a toy for about 10-15 minutes.  Not sure if your potential raiser has other dogs at home but I thought I would share that info in case it mattered.  - The biggest thing that I observed about Guava is her noise sensitivity.  As youÆll notice, where we were filming was a pretty busy area in Manhattan with lots of cars and general noise.  Guava seemed fine with this constant noise as she was able to work well with Julia but she was definitely very aware of all the sounds around her û her ears moved around a lot.  There were a few moments when she would hear a sudden loud noise (a motorcycle for example), which would cause her to startle/rush a bit but she seemed to have good recovery.     In comparison to her previous evaluation, not much has changed.  The following is what I am seeing now (one month later):  - no crate issues  - attention barking just for a few minutes when left alone where humans and dogs are insight. Then will settle quietly.  - makes ""bunny ears"" (ears straight back and laying against head) when alarmed by loud sudden noises.  Recovers quickly and will re-approach objects emitting noise  - No prior history was mention about body handling.  That is one big thing we noticed immediately when we first got her. She does not like to be restrained.  Specifically when rolled on her back, extreme stiffening of her body.  - But oddly enough, will allow you to handle and hold her toes during nail clipping.    - Is unforgiving for quite some time after being released from being restrained.  - have found food does not work as effectively since food gets her too aroused thus adding more stress  - have found successful progression with doing many frequent quick ""catch-and-release"" method of restraint  - very rude dog play with Brady and Anders, lots of neck biting.  But plays respectfully with older dogs like Leonardo, Ensign, Champ  - I take her to my Dulles Gateway puppy class and she interacted and played politely with the other puppies. She is able to work with any handler. She is an amazingly quick study!  - loves riding in crate in the car  - knows her behaviors  - on socialization outings, super well behaved and responsive to name and loose leash and settling  - good energy level.  Requires average level of exercise and low energy level indoors.  ",0

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,F,VA,Yes,iams puppy,"dog play, walks, hikes, fetch","Guava arrived Oct 27 (as of today Nov 23, 4 weeks).    I included notes from her previous raiser and RM Nicole as a baseline:    - Her name response is great!  - She has average energy and can get overwhelmed in too busy of an environment for her.  Raiser lives in a quieter area of Manhattan if that is possible and Guava does well there.  When there was a bike race in her familiar area she became overwhelmed and needed to take it slow.  - She is reported to have minor crating issues but the raiser lives in an apartment complex and has never had any complaints.   - She went to the beach on a long line and tended to pick on the younger shepherd that was with the group.  - She gets excited about people rather than dogs.  She can self modulate well but needs to work on greetings.   - There are two short videos of Guava playing with GEB pup Karat (11 wks old) and then GEB Mandrake (8 mos. Old).  Guava initially played well with Karat for about 5 minutes or so and then Guava started grabbing on KaratÆs neck, ears, etc and was being very rude. We separated the dogs but Guava kept going back at Karat.  I then had Guava play with an older dog (Mandrake) and they played very appropriately with a toy for about 10-15 minutes.  Not sure if your potential raiser has other dogs at home but I thought I would share that info in case it mattered.  - The biggest thing that I observed about Guava is her noise sensitivity.  As youÆll notice, where we were filming was a pretty busy area in Manhattan with lots of cars and general noise.  Guava seemed fine with this constant noise as she was able to work well with Julia but she was definitely very aware of all the sounds around her û her ears moved around a lot.  There were a few moments when she would hear a sudden loud noise (a motorcycle for example), which would cause her to startle/rush a bit but she seemed to have good recovery.     In comparison to her previous evaluation, not much has changed.  The following is what I am seeing now (one month later):  - no crate issues  - attention barking just for a few minutes when left alone where humans and dogs are insight. Then will settle quietly.  - makes ""bunny ears"" (ears straight back and laying against head) when alarmed by loud sudden noises.

He did OK.  but it seemd a bit stressful, i think more on me than it was for him.    he is coming along, he does need a lot of exposure work and he needs to be able to handle his stress and excitablitly levels better.  i am working with him to help him with more acceptable ways such as playing with a toy vs. grabbing my sleeve or pants,  we are 60% there.

Its gotten much better - its not a constant thing - seems very situational - mostly inside my home and especially on a windy day when the house is creaking and making funny sounds.

He's a big burly guy and Talent alerted me to his presence - hackles up, she was ready for any and all contingencies. When she saw who it was, she was a wiggle worm - so happy to see him.

His duration & ability to handle distractions with his commands have improved. His people distractions seem to have gotten worse in the past 2 weeks, but I think his dog distraction has improved. Body handling has little improvement (mainly due to my lack of doing it). I still don't have his people greetings where they need to be. We did the people pack walk prior to the holidays & then didn't do it over the holidays. It seems like Micah's at square 1 with greetings. We definitely need help with that. Also, I need to discuss with you Micah 'poking' me to get my attention. I think I've handled that completely wrong. His behavior/interaction with my dogs (& other dogs) during play is great. I still see dander when we go to new places, but he doesn't need to do check it out as often or as long as he originally did. I don't think that I'm pushing him too hard.

I was quite surprised since her kennel evaluation mention she was timid. Our Airedale passed away ten days ago and Kismet looked for her for the first few days but did not seem to stress over it. She loves to please us and will curl  on any family members lap when we are sitting on the floor. She learns quickly and follows me arround the house. Her average sleep time in the kennel is 8 to 9 hours. Her average kennel time during the day is about two hours. She rides well in the van, truck or PT Cruiser. She will sit or lay on the front floor board or be content to ride in her kennel in the back sit. She has shown no signs of stomach distress while riding in any vehicle. She settles well in a busy enviroment. This was noticed last Saturday when she attended my son's basketball games. We sat in the first row courtside and she layed on the floor nicely. Once in a while she would get up to check out people going up and down the bleachers. Her hearing is excellent and sometimes she hears many things that I don't. I think she is very confident young lady without any aggresive tendencies what so ever. Our largest obstacle right now is the transition from the lamb and rice puppy chow to a high end adult food. We are gradually adding adult food to her meals. Once she can tolerate the adult food we will feed her twice a day. She has behaved very well at our vet's office and he has commended us on her behavior. So far it has been a great experience for us to have such a wonderful animal share our home.",0

He has had more success in the smaller black dog group than in the larger class setting; however, he did very well in his last regular class. He works very well in the smaller group of five dogs. Maintaining the distance that he needs keeps him focused and working well instead of frustrating both of us. We regularly do both people and dog pack walks, both of which seem to be good for him.

Sometimes, he is difficult to reconnect with during a sniffing session, if he is focused on an interesting smell.  We try to avoid this happening in the first place, but sometime he gets very focused on a smell very quickly.  For example, in the elevator, he sniffs the carpet very intensely.  I try to use the leash to restrict his options so that he canÆt reach the floor as easily, because he usually is concentrating too hard to respond to his name.  Usually he will pick his head up with a great effort and look at me, and his teeth will be chattering and his lips flapping aroundùit seems like his body is trying to continue sniffing while his brain is trying to respond to his name being called.  This teeth-chattering thing seems kind of weird to us, and we wanted to see if this was a normal behavior and to ask how we can help Payson keep from sniffing.    We would also like some help working with Payson on getting over his sporadic anxiety about stairs, and his skills in performing commands at a distance.    Otherwise, we have noticed a significant improvement in PaysonÆs house manners and his ability to control his excitement level (especially in public).

Labrador Retriever,Black,F,VA,Yes,Innova Prime grain free Salmon/Herring,"walks, dog play, yard play, ball","Belva is a smart, quite sensitive dog. She is very attuned to the emotions of the people around her and offers her support when she senses that something is not quite right. She is of lower energy and lower drive than most of the other dogs I have had. This makes her easier to work with and take places because she stays in think and learn mode more easily. Her socialization is going very well. One challenge I have with her is to keep her motivated and enthusiastic about her work. You can see this in class when she is much less cooperative at the end of class. Her severe food allergies make using high value treats difficult. A 40 minute walk is about all she is up for, even less on a day where the temperature is above 70 which she considers very hot. Lol  She is a very thorough, thoughtful sniffer û especially around dog smells. It seems like if she were left to her own devices that she would get lost in the smells and sniff endlessly. This is not much of a problem inside, but can be a problem outside. I have found that giving her clear direction about the sniffing is a good approach to take with her. Her mode of choice when we walk in the neighborhood is to walk to the extreme left of the sidewalk with her nose hovered about three inches above the grass. She has learned that IÆm not pleased with her stopping frequently to get a good long sniff anywhere, but this is her compromise so she can still enjoy the lovely smells but keep moving. I have taken to having her walk in the middle of the sidewalk where she will keep her head up better.  Nail clipping continues to be very challenging. She hates it so much. When I get the clippers out she tries to sweet talk her way out of it with wags and kisses. She will lay down for me and I can usually get one done (not always though). Occasionally, I can do another one, but more often than not, after cutting one nail, we have to backtrack almost to the beginning in the desensitizing small steps that lead to the actual cut. Many times she is just too nervous and will get to the point of not wanting to lay down any more. Again, without high value treats it is hard to find something very rewarding for her after getting a nail cut. Her best reward is to put away the clippers which usually gets a very enthusiastic response from her.  I have a note about her eliminating on command. Belva can go for a very long period without needing to get busy. With the dew on the grass and the sprinkler system going during the summer we learned that she does not like to walk on the wet grass. First thing in the morning taking her out I find that if the grass is wet she wonÆt leave the deck. If pick her up and take her out in the yard she stands there looking miserable and may even pick her feet up and shake them like dogs do when the pavement is too hot. The good news is that she can hold it just fine so I donÆt worry that this will lead to accidents in the house. She may, however, wait until the afternoon until she will go. Her record is not going until 3:00. Under normal circumstances, if I take her out any sooner than 6 hours, she wonÆt go. She may just lay down and look at me. So in answer to the question, does she eliminate on command, I have a mixed response in that she will go û if she feels like she has to - you have to be aware of how often she really needs to go out.  BelvaÆs food allergies are severe. I have emailed Dr. Sandler and got permission to feed her a food that is sold both at PetSmart and Petco. Luckily, I have found something that she tolerates pretty well. The huge problem with her is that almost all grain free foods use white potatoes in the formula. Belva is highly allergic to white potatoes (itching, chin acne, blood in her stool). I have been adding various foods that are ingredients in dog foods as a single ingredient added to her regular food to see exactly what she will react to. The choice of dog foods that she can tolerate is very limited and usually very expensive. I plan to continue to experiment with ingredients so I can give Dr. Sandler as much information as possible when she goes up for her IFT since this could be an issue for her as a guide.  All in all we are enjoying Belva immensely. She is a very nice, sweet personality to have in our home. ",0

Nails continue to be a struggle, but we are muddling through. I am able to usually cut one or two nails at a sitting before she has had enough. I settle for that. I want to make note of her energy level. Now granted, I usually end up with the high energy dogs so perhaps I am somewhat biased.

He is very food driven and thinks about food much of the time.  He also scavenges quite a lot.  I think his issues with diarrhea which kept him on low residue food until he was four months old may be playing a part in this.

The weekly class is fantastic, I really enjoy the process of learning how to train the puppy step-by-step. Everybody are so nice and supportive. The only thing I'm grappling with is to figure out the balance of training and letting her just be a puppy. Sometimes I think I'm to strict, which typically drives me crazy because after all she's 4 months old and isn't aware of the necessity of NOT sniffing and tracking or CHEWING. So then I get nervous that I'm too relaxed. ",1

Labrador Retriever,Black,F,NY,Yes,Purina Pro Plan,"play with other dogs, walks","1) body handling: we\'re making good progress, her limitations have decreased some, but still need work. I am arranging with a co-worker for Rumba to be used for animal restraint trainings that will be happening soon for our new vet assistants. Our hospital believes in the less is more approach, and will keep it positive for Rumba.    2) separation anxiety: for the most part Rumba handles me leaving her side pretty well, but when she\'s anxious she\'s very anxious - i.e. barking, crying, trying to get loose from her crate or tether. At work I move about the premises over the course of the day, sometimes I\'m in my own office and other times at the reception desk. When I am on duty at the reception desk Rumba either remains in her crate in my office, or I move her to a pen elsewhere in the hospital, or I tether her beside the reception desk. She is doing very well at the reception desk, as long as I don\'t have to walk away from the area. When I walk away she is very disruptive and anxious. When she is penned vs in her own crate she will settle, but gets very upset if she sees me walk past.    3) distractions: Rumba is fabulous if there are zero distractions, but has a lot of trouble staying focused in the real world. Distractions include other dogs, cats, strange objects, new environments, fluttering leaves or garbage, people approaching or walking nearby, and of course dog scents. I\'ve had a tiny bit of success when I can anticipate that something is going to grab her attention, but that\'s IF I\'ve already got her focused. At class it takes a good 20-30 minutes of class time before she\'ll focus, and then her learning zone limit is about 10-15 minutes before she stops working. This issue has made it hit or miss whether a community exposure will be a success or reinforce her lack of focus.    4) fear after dark: Rumba has not out-grown her fear of stange objects. It is apparant at night and makes me wonder about her vision. She barks, growls and runs away from things in the darkness that are familiar to her, like the doghouse that has always been there, or a toy she dropped in the yard earlier in the day.",0

Labrador Retriever,Black,F,MD,Yes,IAMS Lamb and Rice,"Tennis court running, hide and seek, fetch games, loose leash walking; a bit too energetic","Joanie is a dog with great potential who has unfortunately been bounced around to several different homes -- we are the 4th home in 7 months and it is unclear how consistent her training has been.  She walks phenomenally well on leash when jacketed, but is not mature enough yet to sit still for long.  Does not know settle, place or close commands.    Joanie seems quite smart, but seems to have great difficulty understanding the heel command.  She does well when guided into position by hand motion and with kibble, but is then unable to perform the command at all without a treat.  We have had Joanie for 8 days now.  When we first received her, she knew only how to sit from a stand position (sit down), but not how to sit from a down position (sit up).  She did not know the stand command at all, either verbally or by hand -- by 7 months that's a basic command she should have mastered easily.  So we are essentially starting almost from scratch with Joanie, and focusing right now on just the basics -- sit, down, stand, stay -- and working patiently with her on consistency.    She is stubborn and undisciplined, but that is probably due to the number of home changes she has had and trying to adjust to yet another home and another set of raisers.  However, we are committed to working with her consistently and patiently on the many areas where she needs improvement.  She is affectionate, lovable  and in some areas can be quite eager to please.  The two biggest areas of concern are the significant concern of not just jumping on people but of jumping toward the face, with an attempt to play bite people's faces.    Closely related to that was my observation two days ago of her being very friendly to a group of 4 small children who came to the porch, but then  growling and starting to bark when one of the children moved away fast and started running.  Again, these comments should be taken with some measure of consideration.  We have had Joanie for only 9 days, and these are initial impressions only.    It may be worth noting that Joanie's original raiser lived in a retirement community, and her most recent sitter, with whom she stayed for 4 weeks, also lives in a retirement community, so it's not clear how much exposure Joanie has had to children.",0

I'm pleased at how well and how quickly she is able to settle in many different situations. When out and about she is a dream to work with. She still needs some time to process in new environments but is adjusting more and more quickly as she gets older. I'm especially pleased with how her attention seeking behavior is abating. I am seeing progress there every week. Less nudging my arms when I am working, less trying to climb onto my lap if I'm sitting. These things were pervasive when she came to me. She can simply settle no matter where we are now. Every week brings a new pleasant surprise in what she can handle. She has an affectionate nature and willing personality. I hope with time she can gain even more confidence. ",1

After the dog was contained in the owners arms, Kaiser sat opposite him 20' away at a park bench and calmly settled. BUT today he barked in Rheinbeck at several large dogs on the street, not more than 20' away. My biggest revelation was a stuffed lion in a store window staring at Kaiser. LOTS of barking! We moved back away, got a settle, and then moved a little closer. Each time he move too close too fast, he began a low growl. So we wouldd stay back at a comfortable distance till he settled, and then move closer. I think it was more than 5-6 minutes that it took to get him to the window for a calm ""check it out"". This is Kaiser's biggest challenge . We are also working on a sudden recent concern he has about getting dressed. Lastly, I continue to work on his excitement when he is going out at noon to play. Sometimes we just work the hall and go back.  But we really are enjoying him!",0

Our only problem is occasional barking at unfamiliar dogs, which won't happen the next time he sees that dog, and recently he has been giving a low growl, (more like 'talking') when he sees something novel. The novel thing may be a person standing still, a kid with a balloon, a janitor with a big rolling cart, etc. He makes a quick recovery. When he barks at unfamiliar dogs it usually stops if he can get him a littler further away and let him check the dog out, then get closer. ",0

However, she is easily distracted, and came to us with less than ideal house manners. We've had her for several weeks, and did not start her as a little puppy. As listed above, she has many habits which need work.     When answering questions about body handling, (cleaning ears, etc., I wasn't sure what to answer, because we haven't had the opportunity to do some of those things yet.  I put '5's' for that reason. It would be helpful to have an NA choice for some of the questions.  ",1

He has never jumped on the counter; however, he will occasionally sniff at the dining room table or kitchen countertop.  I place food on a plate - place on floor and he will come when call and not go to the food or other items placed on the floor.  This is an improvement from his last W&T :)",1

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,F,MD,Yes,Iams,is restricted to leash walking,"Dolly began having a limping issue with her rear hind leg on August 16.  Per GEB vet, she was seen by our sponsor vet who prescribed an anti-inflammatory and told to rest.  After completing the medicine, limping began again.  She was subsequently seen by the GEB vet mid October and was diagnosed with suspected soft tissue damage and mandated crate rest for 2-3 weeks and given Rimadyl.  After the Rimadyl was finished, she began to limp again. I drove her back to the GEB vet November 5 and they had her seen by their Orthopedist.  She was diagnosed e with having lumbar/groin injury and  received a laser treatment  and Rimadyl and again placed on strict rest.  After the medication was finished, she began to favor the leg again, although not limping outright. I was given permission to have her seen by a local orthopedist for evaluation and laser treatment.  Orthopedic Vet confirmed previous diagnosis and was prescribed Rimadyl and Robaxin.  This vet recommended 4-6 weeks of weekly physical therapy/laser treatment and home exercises.  First treatment was Monday 1/2.  As a result of all of this, Dolly's training and socialization has been severely compromised.  Stairs continue to be an issue.  She still goes up and down closed stairs like a young pup, with two hind legs scampering together.  She is fearful of open back stairs.",1

Our biggest issue is concern with dogs that come into her space quickly and rudely.  After she has ""met"" a dog even if they are excited initially, she is fine. i have not put her in pup play since because I couldn't be sure that I could call her out if she went out of the T&L zone.  She has done well with all family dogs on swaps too.  She loves to swim, play fetch, puzzle toys and nylabones or stuffed bones.  She is calm when out in public and in crowds.  She is great company.",1

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,M,VA,Yes,Iams smart puppy,walking and playing in yard,"Tahoe was with Siobhan de Courcy and she wrote this up about him.  April 22, 2011 Some thoughts/suggestions/observations from my time with Tahoe  This adorable boy has been a delightful visitor.  He is friendly, responsive, cooperative,  easily engagedùa great, medium-energy pup! I havenÆt identified any significant ôissuesö or problems. He got along well with the other dogs and with the cats, has good (age appropriate) house manners, kenneled easily, was quiet in his crate.  You are doing a really nice job with him!  IÆll share my experience and offer some suggestions.  I will send this to Michele, as well, and urge you to consult with her on all of this.  The two things I would focus on if I were you are:  --TahoeÆs interaction with Nate.  I was so surprised to see Tahoe greet Nate!  While being excitedly greeted by a pup who grabs your clothes and shoelaces and jumps on you may seem cute now, as Tahoe grows this will quickly lose itÆs appeal.  Better to help him make better choices now.  As I suggested to Nate, calmly and kindly redirecting him should help him to improve his greeting.  Call his name and give him a verbal and hand signal for a command he knows, immediately praise him for responding and give him a treat. You can also find a toy to play with to help him occupy his mouth.  Giving him attention while heÆs biting and nipping and jumping is reinforcing that behavior.  The only time I saw Tahoe exhibit these behaviors was with the other dogs:  he greets them by grabbing the side of their face or neck with his mouth, or jumping on them.  The dogs were pretty quick to let him know that a little of this went a long way.  --Tahoe seems a bit timid and he is very sensitive to and uncomfortable with some sounds.  While he may be comfortable around your home and yard, he needs careful exposure and support in order to help he be comfortable in many different environments. His daily outing should be planned to include careful and well-supported exposure to new and different places and sounds.  A pup that is comfortable in his environment walks happily alongside of you, he doesnÆt lag a few steps back as Tahoe can do.  It is important for him to be exposed to many things at his young age. IÆd be happy to discuss this more with you and/or to go places with you.    IÆll start by responding to what you shared on the puppy sit form* and in conversation, and then IÆll tell you about my experiences with him on outings.   ?",1

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,M,NY,Yes,Iam's Puppy,Walking / running enclosed yard,"Tad in my opinion is a very confident happy pup. The first day we brought him home he was initially aggressive towards our family dog at times, and we have seen that problem go away.      When we took hold of Tad to stop him from biting the family dogs face he became upset and displayed an  ""edge"", by growling, and getting mouthy when not allowed to have his way.  We have been working on that and he does not show the aggressive behavior he did initially.  The two dogs have now bonded and we just need to curb his normal puppy enthusiam at times. He now is compliant with verbal commands and stops going after the other dog.          From day one Tad did seem familiar with a kitchen setting, and it appeared he may have been given some rewards previously in a kitchen setting.  As example when the fridge was opened he came running to it with great interest.  Same with stove when we were using it.   We have worked on kitchen manners and it appears that his initial behavior is resolved.    He demand barked also from the first day we had him.  We did notice that he had what looked like teeth marks on his nose, like he had been in a scrap with another pup or cat.          These behaviors just made us feel that he was allowed to get away with inappropriate behavior before and we addressed it.        Tad has had numerous previous playtimes with GEB Tana 16 months and GEB Fred 9 months, and two other GEB dogs and they have interacted very well.     Tad last month was handled by students in PPPC and accepted commands and acted appropriately with numerous students.   Tad was at the Cornell Vet School Open house, and interacted very well with all ages, handled  by very young children,  did not display any stress or frustration at any time.         Tad at home gets to play in fenced in yard area a few times a week with a ten year old male lab, and a female Lab pup a month younger than him  He interacts very well with both these dogs, and has not displayed any aggression, and is well mannered with both the older dog and pup.   We have been working on his barking and  is doing much better as he develops.  I have been setting up distraction situations with people and other dogs, working on his barking and command compliance.   He can be headstrong, but once he understands what is expected he then increases compliance and barking etc, reduces.     Tad is a very intelligent pup, is good natured and calm in the house.  He is an normal level active pup that requires excercise and interaction & play time with other active dogs.   He does have an edge to him when he does not get his way and gets frustrated at times.  This behavior is associated with his interaction with our family dog, or when he is tired.   As when he is given a time out, he does settle down and does not display that type of behavior.    I can only relate it to a time out with a child, as Tad seems to learn not to repeat that behavior, when he and our family dog are brought back together again.   I trust Tad (95%) with our family dog now, just need to monitor his normal puppy play / behavior.    He is very good riding in the car, and accompanies me to my office, right now a few times a week.   The more exposure I give him the better he becomes.                 ",0

He can and does do it often. Out in the park, me reading a book... 20-30minutes, he might not ever just lie down and relax unless directed and might even whine then (now that I think about it).

Labrador Retriever,Black,F,VA,Yes,Iams Puppy Chow - Smart Dog,"Walks at shopping centers, churches, parks, road","As a new raiser who has had Dixie for just a few weeks, I believe she is adjusting well.  She is sleeping all night, eating well and is a very sweet puppy who loves being with you.  At this stage, she loves to explore and can easily be distracted by smells, nuts and things to eat  on our walks,etc.  She will drop whatever she has in her mouth when told ""out"" and patience is required when waiting for her to return.  Greeting people needs to be worked on more.  For things that shouldn't be done like play biting and jumping on the couch, the word ""Uh oh"" and ""I'm not very happy"" has become connected to something that she shouldn't be doing.  Most of the time she will stop when this is said.  She is so smart! It doesn't take much for her to understand what you want. I will miss her, but hope to babysit on a regular basis and to stay in touch with other raisers.",1

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,M,VA,Yes,Iams,"Walking downtown, lots of running after and fetching ball and toys, loves to play tug, and recently began responding very well to ""out."" He plays well with other dogs, no aggression or biting. In the office, he is great most of the time settling and enter","Troy is very willing, can focus wonderfully, walks in the city on a loose lead, places on grates, ""stays"" in high foot traffic areas inside and out, recalls quickly when focused, is not barking in the office much at all any more, is staying focused on me much more now in the office with other people all around, checks in with me a lot during walks, can correct his own position on walks, spits out pieces of bark and sidewalk stuff he picks up-without me telling him to now, can play outside - with the chickens and horses loose in the pasture and not pay them any mind , has never tried to leave the yard (he would tho, if another dog came around), and has had really good walks in Colonial Williamsburg with other dogs on leashes, but just as often has ""bad"" days when other dogs are just too much for him to handle well. He's brilliant when he's good and yet has to be removed from class or other dogs when he can't control his excitement. ""Approach and retreat"" seems to work to help him handle these times, and I'm highly hopeful it will help him get over his emotional response when dogs are around. Our new outside classroom should give us the room for approach and retreat. It's not about the task when he is over-excited...it's about having the patience and several strategies to help him through the behavior with his dignity and confidence intact. Troy is amazing...he's a very quick, smart, willing, affectionate, friendly pup with some challenging inconsistancies and over-excited reactions to other dogs, but we will work hard to get past those so he can put his talents to the best use.",0

His walking is still progressing but we've been really happy with how much he's improved. We are struggling the most with his greetings of people and his excitement around other dogs. This is a problem both indoors at our house, and outdoors when new people approach him. Their baby talk really provokes him to start jumping and going nuts. When people ignore him, he's generally calm -- so when we settle in new places, he has typically done very well. When he's very distracted, it is hard to get his attention. ",1

He remains eager to please and very treat motivated. His behavior in class remains relatively poor: he is distracted and excited by the other dogs and he needs about 20 minutes to settle. In addition, he is completely crazy for Janet Newcity, and when he hears her or sees her he yelps for her with joy. We're not sure what to do about it but it makes class very challenging.",1

He does need our full attention when wide awake and out of the kennel or he will quickly get into trouble.  He does try to eat sticks outside a lot which then makes him vomit. We follow the GEB protocol for vomiting, which says to withhold food for 12hrs. This seems to exacerbate the problem, because Manny is more hungry then and tries all the harder to get sticks:)!  I am also working on riding in the car with Manny in the passenger footspace. He tends to jump up while I'm driving, making things dangerous. I put things on the seat to prevent his jumping onto the seat. I have been stopping the car when possible when he gets up and I put him in the kennel ASAP( in the back of the car) if he doesn't go down or sit. I think we're making progress on this.

German Shepherd,Black/tan,F,NY,Yes,Purina ProPlan L&R,"walks, hikes, play w/ other dogs","1) Moxie has had excellent health since the day she left the CDC. Other than 2 brief cystitis/urethritis episodes when younger which responded immediately to antibiotics, she has had no health issues. Her stools have been perfect, 1st on Purina Lg Breed Puppy Chow, and now on Purina ProPlan Lamb & Rice. She has never missed a meal!  2) Lots of body handling & massage, wearing tank tops and then the longer puppy coats for eating, playing, bone-chewing, hanging out, etc.  seem to have helped with much of her body sensitivity, though she will still occasionally briefly turn to nose her apparel or stop to scratch at it briefly (1 to a few seconds).  3) She has a pleasant energy level and can readily settle in any environment I have exposed her to, loves to work, appears to love and have endless energy for learning & for rising to new challenges in skills, activities, and environmental exposures. She is motivated by handler praise & interaction, food, toys, go sniff command, and many life rewards.  4) She has extremely quick reactions which makes teaching her easy, but also can work to her detriment if she thinks she should be in charge. While action and movement excite and arouse her, for the most part she can split attention and resume/maintain focus on the handler and the activity or work ay hand. She will respond readily to direction in almost all situations so far with the exception of some dog interactions I have described above - I understand she may be making her best guess/choice at behavior, but I would like help with teaching her better choices if that is at all possible. Having expressed that concern, I can also say that she is quick to lower her arousal and work with me offering requested behaviors at a relatively short distance as well as to appear to relax very nicely with massage. I am not sure whether this inappropriate play arises from being single female with six male sibs, whether estrogen effect after 1st heat will be beneficial, or whether she is uncertain with some dogs and wants to settle or dominate the action - and maybe none of that makes a difference.   5) Moxie is overall a lovely, fun pup to raise and have around. She is teaching me a lot and is giving me and her other 2 raisers, Maura Cornish and Ellen Joseph, much pleasure in the process.",0

He is still a wonderful dog, and very easy to live with, but has more issues with distraction and excitement than he did a few months ago.  I have been using a prong collar on him some of the time (especially when I know we are going to an area with high distraction), and he is excellent when it is on.  With just the martingale, he is harder to control, and doesn't listen as readily.  HIs confidence is great, and his temperament is phenomenal.  I think it is mostly age related.  I'm trying to up his exercise, and have begun biking short distances with him, which he loves and is very well behaved when doing.  His biggest issue is that he gets overly excited when playing with other dogs, and starts neck biting and barking.  I am interrupting play frequently, and not letting the energy level get up there, but it is challenging.  I'm looking forward to you seeing him, Jane, and getting your opinion on how he's doing!",1

She has low distraction around other animals and dogs - not so much with her GEB friends -  but focuses in on me when asked. She has been pausing a little longer to look at the seagulls on the beach lately however  when I say ""lets go"" she responds instantly and moves along with me. So she's gaining confidence - is much more aware of her world and her place in it - but has the self control to reign it in and stay on message when asked. I continue to work mostly long line except in public place and really busy traffic areas.  I continue to work with paw handling and her nail clipping - she thinks its all great fun until we get down to brass tacks - patience is the key - I'm trying to take my time, little steps and not shoot for the moon - some days we clip, some days not. One nail at a time is my mantra!!!  Thanks Kerry!!  ",1

He's not destructive, which is good. Marcus loves to run, and as such his leash walking isn't that great. I'm a little worried with his class behavior. It's gotten progressively worse. He gets very intense about other dogs and must be redirected, otherwise he will bark and pull towards them. Generally, Marcus is very chill, but he's started to get more and more excited when people visit. He has had some problems with vomiting (usually late in the day before dinner). Overall though, he's an excellent pup and very connected to his handler. He likes to be close with people at all times.",1

Labrador Retriever,Yellow,F,VA,Yes,AdvoDerm,walks/frisbee/dog play,"Jenny has grown in confidence and energy level. She is testing both me and the other dogs. She is no pushover. She is very smart and is a thinker and problem solver. However, what she considers a problem is not always what I consider a problem. It is fun to watch her wheels turn. She thinks she can talk and tries her best to communicate with me. She is very connected and tuned in.    The major thing we are working on is having her settle while I disconnect from her. She would prefer to keep moving, and if we arenÆt moving that I at least engage her and feed her treats. She considers æsettlingÆ a problem that she would like to fix. She is making good progress though. She is now letting me sit and disconnect without doing all kinds of behaviors to get my attention. She still doesnÆt lay down and settle for long without getting ansy, but itÆs a process.     Jenny walks well in all environments and shows good confidence. She is fabulous with noises and has very low small animal distractions. She is great around other dogs and children. She is observant and pays attention to her environment. IÆm very excited about Jenny because she has some real potential to be a fabulous guide.  ",0

She has always kept her crate clean.  3) Gladys responds well to clear expectations - will work for food, toys, play, life rewards.

She does well with slow and careful exposures, and I have found short outings and watching her body language carefully is important - she will start to pant, occasionally yawn, sniff more, move more quickly and lose focus and connection if she is unsure of herself. Some of her social outings have included 3 different post offices, CVS drugsore in quiet times, a church service concert and coffee hour (many people greetings) afterwards, library, 1/4 mile track in Yorktown, settling at staff meetings and committee meetings, quiet residential neighborhoods in White Plains, bigger street in White Plains on Sunday morning - minimal traffic, Yorktown, Shrub Oak, Mt.

German Shepherd,Black/tan,F,NY,Yes,Purina Dog Chow,"Walking, play w/ other dogs, hike on drag line","Gladys has made vast improvement in many areas. 1) A diet change has resulted in a healthy weight gain and 1-2 normal bowel movements/day compared to several soft ones/day when she 1st arrived.  2) She is now housetrained and goes to the door or comes to me or paces around when she needs to go out & get busy - she would sometimes urinate and defecate indoors when she 1st arrived and was often too distracted outdoors to relax &get busy on request. She has always kept her crate clean.  3) Gladys responds well to clear expectations - will work for food, toys, play, life rewards. While she has shown a quick and sometimes marked startle response, she is extremely resilient - has never ""shut down,"" and has always been willing to ""go check it out."" And repeatedly approach from different directions, etc. When she 1st came to me, my assessment was that she had high visual, auditory, and olefactory distraction - probably contributing to the difficulty Lucille had in getting her house-trained. She does well with slow and careful exposures, and I have found short outings and watching her body language carefully is important - she will start to pant, occasionally yawn, sniff more, move more quickly and lose focus and connection if she is unsure of herself. Some of her social outings have included 3 different post offices, CVS drugsore in quiet times, a church service concert and coffee hour (many people greetings) afterwards, library, 1/4 mile track in Yorktown, settling at staff meetings and committee meetings, quiet residential neighborhoods in White Plains, bigger street in White Plains on Sunday morning - minimal traffic, Yorktown, Shrub Oak, Mt. Kisco, Katonah, Briarcliff Manor, Brewster, New Paltz, shopping center parking lots and walking in front of store fronts, automatic doors. I think she needs time to take new things in with ALL of her senses, and I tried to keep outings limited to 20 minutes or less so that she would get new exposures without feeling overwhelmed. I think she is still a fairly immature 9 month old, but has made great progress. She does very well with support - how she will do when she doesn't have that support, I don't know, because she still seems pretty young to me. She is a very sweet, very pleasant pup, loves to run and play, but has also done very well ""hanging out "" when I am at work and did fine with almost no exercise for several days in a row. She continues to improve re dog distraction, and will offer auto checkins some of the time if the dog-dog distance is appropriate. High value treats get her interest readily.

Sometimes he can be a little too excitable in attempting to comply with his standard (sit, stay, heel, etc.) requests by offering behavior different than that requested in his desire to earn the treat reward; he can be calmed down with a patient attitude and redirection.  Pablo has a very sensitive stomach and did not thrive on IAMS (dandruff, licking paws, diarrhea) and had a long transition to his new food. He is more likely to have soft stools when given a treat that another Lab eats without any effect.    He is a beautiful dog, runs like the wind, swims without fear, loves us completely, and we are going to miss him terribly when his time comes.  ",0
