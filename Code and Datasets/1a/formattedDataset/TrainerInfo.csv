31,Primary,28398,0,Montgomery,10WW15,Woodstock,20276,11/15/15,"We usually wake up at 6:30. Between then and 8:30, three kids have to leave the house to go to school. However, I have some free time between one kid and the next one.  At 8:30, we walk to the elementary school (15 minutes). After that, I usually take a couple of hours for reading (at a library) and walking on the Crescent Trail (a puppy can be with me for both activities).   I usually have errands to do in the morning, but I have agreed with rest of the family that I will do most of my activities in the afternoon, so that I can spend more time at home until everybody is back from school.   At 3:00 I leave house to go and pick up the youngest at school. The afternoon is a mix of activities and homework. As we are 5 in the house, we can take turns and make sure someone is always at home with the puppy.  I work once a week in a museum. I need to plan so that the puppy is not home alone for too long. I could go to the museum later in the day, so someone else can be home on time.   Weekends are less predictable, but as we are many, it shouldn't be a problem to arrange our schedule around the puppy's needs, at the beginning. When he grows, he will be able to come with us to most activities (soccer games, regattas)   "

I have no exerccise restraints. I am planning to have the dog accompany me almost everywhere, so ideally a dog that is easygoing and friendly (which all the dogs are). I also babysit for multiple families in Annapolis that have children ages 2-10, and older dogs/cats so I need a dog that is ok around kids and other animals.  "
41,Primary,28396,0,Capital,5J315,Junior,20423,11/03/15,"I live with my husband in a small brick house with a fully-fenced back yard, across from a park, in an urban neighborhood. I get up very early each week day morning to participate in an exercise class, so I would let the pup out in the yard to ""get busy"" and play for a bit before my class (about 5:30 AM), and then again when I get home (7 AM) for play, breakfast, a walk, ""get busy"", some training during those activities, etc. My work day is flexible - on days where I must be in the office all day my neighbor has agreed to help with letting the puppy outdoors and having play/exercise time. My neighbor also has a fully fenced yard and no other pets. I work from home 2 days/week, and on the weekends I am around the home, doing errands, visiting with friends, taking walks and long hikes, etc. I lead a very active and outdoors lifestyle, and usually meet with friends for some outdoor hikes. In the summer I like to stand up paddle board on the river, and my last dog (a family pet) had his own life jacket and used to love to sit on the paddle board or swim alongside (on a leash) with me. I also go jogging most mornings, and when the pup is older and strong enough I know s/he would love to keep me company for a few miles around the neighborhood each morning.   I have always had a pet dog, and have always raised them from a puppy. Now, my last dog is in heaven and my home has no pets. All my dogs were very well trained, but I am excited about learning the Guiding Eyes training methods. My dogs have always had active, rich, and fun social lives, with lots of outdoor activities. I look forward to sharing that fun with a Guiding Eyes pup."

All dogs in the neighborhood are in a fenced yard or on a leash when out.  The neighbors are friendly and are often outside to walk and chat.    All members of our family are fit and healthy.  Our two oldest children, 11 & 7, are homeschooled.  They will be home with their mother all day for most days.  I have my own design business.  I have a small office in Easton, MD.  I take my 5 year old son to school in Easton 4 days a week on my way to work.  We are back at home by 3:00 on most days.  On Fridays I typically work from home.  If my homeschoolers happen to go on a fieldtrip, I will take the puppy with me to work.    Bottom line . . . the puppy will be with family members nearly all day everyday.    Weekends could include any of the following:  being outside at home, sports events, church, town festivals, shopping, focusing on training a new puppy, etc."

Previously, I was away from home for 9 hours each day.  My 17 year old daughter stays at home with me.  She has had brain tumors and has some special needs.  We will be co- raising the puppy.  My son is almost 15, he attends school each day.  He is not sold on having a puppy.  He has not had good dog experiences.  I would not be surprised if he falls in love with the puppy.  My fianc√© lives in Fenwick Island, Delaware.  He is also not sold on having a puppy, cramping his style.  We go to his home most weekends.  He is in our home most of the time also.  We are getting married in January.  We will probably need a puppy sitter.  We haven't made any wedding plans, yet.  I know this is not going to be easy.  I just feel called to do this.

Pablo is at the university, and Gabriela  is a 12 year old girl at 6th grade.    I am working most of the time seating at a computer screen.  I telework 60% for the time, going to DC always on Tuesday and Thursdays.(This is not flexible, those are the days that I have to attend work).   My husband works close by to home, so he will be coming at Lunch time on these particular days to let the dog out of the crate.  My daughter Gabriela is going to be also working with the dog training on weekends and evenings.  .   I have sleep problems, therefore is recommended for me to have a full night sleep without interruptions if I can achieve it.  So we will be looking forward when the dog can sleep all night in his crate without interruptions. My daughter or my husband will take the responsibility to take the dog out during the night.  We leave in a 1 acre property, not fenced.  So we will need to be always out with the dog on a leash"
44,Primary,28323,0,Dominion,7H315,Hilton,20411,11/01/15,"I am a stay at home mom and writer, so my schedule is fairly flexible.  I take my son to school at 8 and pick him up at 3:30.  In between I may go to an exercise class or my writing group or a volunteer activity, but I am rarely gone from the house for more than 2-3 hours at a time.  In the afternoons, evenings, and weekends we have a few activities, but again would not be gone for more than a few hours.      We have a 10 year old male Cardigan Welsh Corgi.  He gets along well with other dogs and enjoys playing when off leash.  When on leash he tends to be timid/submissive and excitable.  He gets excited around new people, particularly males, and barks at noises outside.  His herding instinct is evident as he likes to ""keep tabs"" on us all and is happiest when we are all together in one room.    Our son is 7 years old.  He is generally calm and gentle, but is also a typically active little boy.      We live in a single family home with easy access to the outdoors.  There are many walking paths in the neighborhood.  We walk our dog several times a day for exercise as we do not have a fenced area.  This is in addition to short outings/play sessions in the immediate front yard (during which the puppy would be on leash).      "

35,Primary,28321,0,Orange County,1O315,Ollie,20472,11/13/15,"My Life    Monday, Tuesday, Thursday--I leave for school at around 6:45am and come home at around 3pm. Occasionally I come home at 3:30, if I need to stay after for something. However, I will be buying or leasing a car within the next few weeks (by mid-December the latest), so once that happens I will leave at around 7:05 and then get home at 2:30, or 3 if I need to stay after school. Unless I'm doing something after school (which I usually don't), I am home for the rest of the day. When I get home, I usually have a snack and relax for like 30 minutes. After that, I do my homework, shower, and then go to sleep at like 10-11pm, unless I have a lot of homework, in which case I can be up later.     Wednesday & Friday--These days start out like Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, except I have work after school. I start work at 4. I work at a pizzeria in Goshen, which is pretty close to where I go to school. Since I live around 5.5 miles from the center of Goshen, I have to stay in town for that period of time. I usually get a smoothie and do homework or something. I get out of work at 9 (9:30 if I have to clean up, which usually happens on Fridays because it gets very busy) and then my mother picks me up and takes me home. Sometimes, If my dad is home from work, I come home from school on the bus and drive his car in. Once I get my own car, I can go home between school and work, so I'd get home at around 2:30 and then leave for work at around 3:40ish. Once I get home from work, I take a shower and finish whatever homework I didn't finish between the time I got out of school and went to work.    Saturday--I don't have school on Saturday, so I can sleep until around 9 or 10. I do homework and stuff in the morning and then go to work from 4-9:30.     Sunday--My family goes to church from 9-10 and then we go home and eat bagels. We usually go to visit my grandparents in Rockland in the afternoon.     Note--I go to high school, so my school schedule varies depending on breaks and things of that nature.     What is Not Flexible--I need my job. I was originally working Thursday, Friday, Saturday but then switched Wednesday and Thursday so I be available for puppy classes, so I don't think I have any more scheduling issues with that. I also need to go to school so there is no way I can work that out of my schedule.    What is Flexible--I didn't put anything about when I hang out with friends and stuff like that because my social life is very flexible.     Some stuff you should know about where I live--I live on a main road and not in a development or close to an area with a lot of people/buildings/stores/etc, so I'm going to need to drive the pup around a lot in order to get him to social experiences. I would need a pup that is good in cars.     Other--I'm 17 so I am capable of bending down, walking for long periods of time, etc. No small children in the house. "

I am currently not working, but will expect to start working again in 2016.

My highschool kids are driving, and have a flexible highschool schedule which allow them to come home for lunch 2-3 days a week.  My husband works fulltime, but is only 5 miles from our house and can also come home sometimes during lunch or work from home.    I usually get up early (5:00 or 6:00am ) and exercise, check emails.  then make breakfast and see kids off to school.  Then I work on the computer, run errands, take on-line classes, go to yoga etc.   The kids get home around 3:00 and go to band, soccer, track practice etc.  Sometimes I go with them.    I make dinner at 6:00, then we try to have some family TV/Movie time.    On weekends we go to outdoor shows with my son's bands, go to soccer games or other sports, bike ride, go visit my son at college.  We have a large fenced yard in a nice neighborhood with many kids and dogs.  We have not had our own dog, but we have all helped our neighbors with dog walking and pet care over the years.  We do have an elderly cat who will do his best to avoid contact with the dog, but will not like to be chased.  We can block our stairs so the cat can retreat upstairs when he needs to get away.    We started working with Veteran's Moving Forward last spring and did a weekend puppy sit for one of their dogs (4 months).  We attended several training sessions with them, but decided not to proceed with them because they required we attend training every Wednesday morning at a location 40 minutes from my home in addition to biweekly training on Sundays.  The Wednesday training did not work well with our schedule.    Also FYI - I ran a home based daycare for a couple years and we fostered kittens for FOHA  "
22,Primary,28298,0,South Western CT,13L315,Lucille,20446,11/16/15,"I work from home 5 days a week and don't have to travel for work too often. This will give me the ability to let the pup out when needed, integrate training throughout the day, and make myself the reward. I also have flexibility to start work between 7 and 9 and end between 3:30 and 5. This gives me more flexibility to do walks or socialization in the AM or PM depending on weather and how much light is in the sky. We don't have children so the pup will be the main target of our love and direction and we will be able to bring him/ her to socialize in a variety of situations and will be able to focus on the pup to integrate training throughout the day. We own our home and have a grassy front and back yard as well as a patio and plenty of places to walk the pup.

I may be able to take the dog to work with me and have her stay in the teachers lounge while I am out skiing. I typically teach for an hour or two and then have an hour break and then teach for another hour or two and so on so that I can spend time in between lessons walking her around the resort, and getting her used to lots of people. I will have to work that out with my employer. That part time job lasts typically until the end of February. When I will be home full time again. I am a runner, hiker and backwoods skier, and plan to have the dog accompany me as soon as she is old enough.

I have had many dogs over my lifetime.  I use to foster dogs, take them to obedience classes and then find them very suitable homes.  I have done a lot of dog sports over the years - agility, fly ball, frisbee, sheep herding and showing dogs in both breed and obedience.      I am open to any puppy.

During the school year, we can be busy in the evenings with sports practices and/or appts. with the kids.  Our weekends are more relaxing unless we have a sporting event to attend for one of the kids.

68,Primary,28102,0,Eastern MA,4I315,Irvin,20416,09/22/15,"My typical day (M-F) is to get up at 6am and be out the door by 6:50 to catch the commuter train into Downtown Boston. I leave the office at 5pm and am home by 6:10. In the evening I typically like to go to the gym or head outside for a walk (weather permitting!). I'm usually in bed a little after 10pm.   I have spoken with my manager and the head of my department at work and they have both given me permission to flex my schedule around the pup and his needs. My fiance, Craig, is a graduate student who has limited need to be on campus, and who can spend the bulk of the day at home with the pup (and is eager to do so!). On days where Craig needs to be out of the house for more than 3 hours, we will coordinate my leaving work early or getting to work late so that the pup is not home alone for more than 3 hours.  On the weekends we typically spend the morning making a big breakfast, and we generally like to get outside when the weather permits it. In Waltham we have several nice outdoor spaces that we're eager to take the puppy to (we live very close to Prospect Park, a conservation area, as well as the Charles River Walkway, and have aspirations to get out to the Berkshires for some day hikes). Some weekends and most holidays we head to New Hampshire to visit my parents, who have property on a small lake in Acworth, NH. They have an Aussie-doodle (he weighs about 30 lbs.) who is very exuberant but excellent with other dogs: Max is very submissive. The NH property is secluded from other houses on the lake and has access to lots of wooded trails and outdoor space, as well as extensive waterfront. Sundays in the fall we love staying in in the afternoon and watching football, and occasionally invite friends over to watch the game with us: Go Pats!  We live in a large one-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor of a dog-friendly apartment building which has elevator access and dog waste bins near all of the exits. It also has a large fenced yard in the back that is open to all residents.   I would say we're moderately active (we like to hike and take lots of walks, play tennis, go skiing in the winter, and I run and box) and without any physical ailments that would impede taking care of a dog. My fiance is in the midst of writing his dissertation, so when he's home he's typically working on that or on lesson plans and is pretty low-key.   Our wedding is scheduled for August 16, 2016. We're embarking on the planning for that but hope to keep it a low-key, stress-free affair in Vermont (as low-key and stress-free as weddings go!). My fiance's family lives in the United Kingdom, so we do do some traveling to visit them occasionally (once a year mostly for about a week at a time). We have a trip planned to the UK for mid-May, 2016, for a wedding and will be gone for a week. Otherwise I would foresee that any other travel we do is local (New England-based) and dog-friendly!"

Really enjoy my time there pottying , supervising play time, grooming, feeding and cleaning the kennels. The dogs seem to enjoy me too and I joke that it's because they are training to be of help and they sense that I need a lot of help ? :-). Wake up between 6a and 8a. Go to the gym shortly after. Rest of day is running errands, visiting, volunteering, taking and giving martial arts classes. My kids are happy and supportive of me and would enjoy visiting and interacting with the puppy. I'm more on the sensitive/soft side but am also very conscious of not teaching/reinforcing any bad manners and following the Guiding Eyes training guidelines/ seeking assistance if needed. "

96,Primary,27986,0,Southern CT,5OO15,Opie,20190,07/24/15,"Overall, I have a flexible schedule. My work week is Monday thru Friday, however I work for myself and make my own hours. The work environment is very calm in that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist and Yoga Therapist. The office is about 15 min from my house and is located on the second floor of a very old factory building, think Erector Sets the toy from years and years ago! It has wooden floors and big windows that are up higher, a very forgiving environment with lots of stairs and hallways. I can easily have a kennel there and my clients are looking forward to meeting our new friend. I plan to have enough time inbetween appointments to give the pup my complete attention, which is just a matter of how I choose to book the appointments. I can also have the pup at home and break up the day from morning and afternoon by being home for several hours. Most probably a bit of both. Two Wednesdays a month I am away from home from 8:45 until 5:00 (including travel time) working in a corporate setting. On these 2 days my daughter (Alison 31) has agreed to spend time with our little girl or guy. Joan Moore, also a puppy raiser, has also agreed to me dropping the pup off at her house for some pup playtime. I don't work on weekends. The home life looks like this: 2 female sister cats who are 2.5 years old and do not go outside. They have never scratched or bitten me or anyone else, and are very timid although curious and friendly. They are up to date on their shots and I use Revolution on them even though they are inside, just to be safe. My partner is John Terry who is an absolute lover of all animals and most importantly very well trained by me! (Hehehe) Meaning, he understands that I am the main trainer for the pup and he is willing to be on the same page with me in all the activities concerning the pup. We live in a small cape home (1,200 sq feet) which is already animal safe because of our cats. We do not have sidewalks, and the road we live on is relatively busy, however, there are side roads which are not. I am also willing to drive to where there are sidewalks to get a diversified experience. I believe that we are relatively well setup for this experience. I can only say relatively because it hasn't happened yet! But wherever we may be lacking we are willing to do what we need to do to improve the accommodations. I am a bit nervous! It's a tremendous responsibility, however, I also know that I communicate better with all animals than people, so I feel confident to learn the language. I have had 2 dogs before in my life, they were my best friends and will always be a part of who I am. In retrospect, I am surprised they were as well behaved as they were considering I knew nothing! An additional thought I would like to add is my request for a black dog. I live in black leggings for my work and the maintenance of the removal of yellow hair would be something that I really would rather not have to devote time to. I do hope that doesn't sound offensive in any way, but if I know me, this pup is going to very close to me most of the time and I plan on being hairy. I also believe, but perhaps not accurately, that the female black labs tend to be a little smaller, which given the ways in which I depend on the well being of my fingers, hands and arms, might make more sense for me. All THAT being said, I soooo do not wish to create criteria that puts me right out of the program, so it's just my humble opinion. Oh, and I bend, crawl, jump, bark and roll over. Wait, I won't bark.  I hope I have created a picture that is clear, and user friendly for all of us. Thank you for this wonderful opportunity, I have already learned so very much and it's hardly begun. Peace"
98,Primary,27985,0,Southern CT,6NN15,Nomi,20199,07/19/15,"I will be a senior this year at LOLHS. Our school day is from 7:40-2:10. I have no extracurricular actives until Spring Season (Crew). When I get home from school, I do my homework and also spend time with my scottish terrier, Nutella. Nutella is 11 years old. We also have a guinea pig that is 4 years old. My mom and I live in a house near the beach. We live in a neighborhood where there are a few other dogs. Our backyard is fenced in but we have lots of opportunities for walks on the beach or to go running.   Every other weekend, I take the train to my father's in NYC (he is okay with the classes on Saturday). They have a King Charles Cocker Spaniel named Rooney who will be 10 years old.   During the weekends that I am in OL, I relax or find different activities like the beach or hanging out with friends. "
106,Primary,27962,0,Catoctin,3EE15,Emily,20072,07/01/15,"My household is made up of just my husband and me.  We currently do not have any other pets.  During the week, we live in a small townhouse, but on the weekends we live in a slightly larger log home on 15 acres.  Neither home has a fence so we are used to constantly having the dogs we have owned in the past on leash.      The townhouse is three levels and the floor surfaces are vinyl tile, concrete, and carpet.  We have stairs that go down into the basement and up to the second floor.  Our townhouse backs up to a small shopping area that has a grocery store, two eating establishments, and other small retail establishments.  There is always some type of activity going on in the neighborhood either the yard crews are cutting the grass (noisy lawnmowers, leaf blowers), kids are playing in front of our house, the mailman is delivering the mail, etc.  We also live about 5 blocks from an elementary school and community pool - all of this is in our subdivision.  There are sidewalks and bike paths to walk the puppy along. We walk to the grocery store 2-3 times a week to go grocery shopping.  We have a fire department 3 blocks from our house that has fire trucks and an ambulance. We also live close to Frederick City and can go into the city in the evenings for social outings.  The city has a lot more cars and distractions then at either of our other two houses.      Out at the cabin, the puppy will get to experience, rocky roads, dirt paths, grassy paths, various wildlife (turkey, deer, bear, snakes, bobcat, grouse etc.), mud, and lots of water.  The log house is 2 hours from our townhouse so the puppy will get used to ""riding"" with us.  The floor surfaces inside the home are ceramic tile, carpet, and hardwood flooring.  We have sliding glass doors and the inevitable screen doors that all of our dogs have had to learn about.    I have family that live on the Eastern shore so the puppy will be exposed to the bay and ocean, Annapolis, sea gulls, sand, etc.      During the week, my husband works from home 5 days a week and I work at home 2 days a week.  My husband travels about 2-3 times a year for about a week at a time.  I travel anywhere from 0-6 times a year from 1-2 weeks each time.  The puppy will not be going on work travel since we will be in areas that do not allow animals.  My husband and I coordinate travel so one person will be home while the other person is traveling.  Once the puppy is housebroken and has a little more self-control he will be going to my office with me.  My office is an hour away from my house and I leave at 5 AM.  Work consists of sitting around reading at my desk, going to meetings, going to the Farmer's Market on Tuesdays, riding in elevators, walking up stairs, going through sliding glass doors, going to the cafeteria for lunch, going through security check points, walking on carpet, tile, marble, and concrete.  I work on a Federal Government Campus so we are fairly isolated and there is a lot of open space and trees where I work.  Inside the buildings, there is a lot of glass and open spaces.  My job may be changing soon which will mean less work traveling and more time actually going into the office instead of working from home.  It will just mean that the puppy makes the trek into my office more times per week then he would be doing now.      Any personal travel that my husband and I have done in the past we have always brought our dogs so vacation time is making sure the dogs can go along too.  The puppy will be used to hotels and long rides.    That's about it.  Our life is pretty ordinary, but we do have a lot of different things going on."
101,Primary,27954,0,Ohio,6AA15,Ambrie,20016,07/06/15,"Most of my day is flexible. I stay home with two daughters, Ava (15 yrs) and Ashley (11 yrs).  My husband is home a little more than 1/2 the month and travels the rest of it.  The girls are self-sufficient and help with chores.  I get up and make them breakfast/lunch for school, and they are off by 7:30-2:50 school days.  Once they leave I usually eat breakfast, check e-mail, pay bills, paperwork, gardening, pick up the house, grocery shop, exercise (walk, bike, weights at home or yoga), or work.  I own a small business (TootSweetSoapShack.com) making handcrafted goat's milk soap and cream, and sugar scrubs.  Making products usually takes about 90 min - 2 hours at a time start to finish, then wrap the products at a separate time.  I deliver my products locally to 3 small stores as needed, and wrap up local orders to leave on my porch.  I try to start dinner before the kids get home, we usually eat dinner after school before activities start.  Most of my older daughter's activities (Pole Vault Club, Aerial Silks, Dance Classes, Village Project Volunteer, Key Club Member, Horse Riding Sessions) are at the high school or in town.   My younger daughter Ashley is involved with Oberlin Choristers (Monday night practice and occasional recitals), Vocals at School of Rock in Rocky River (45 min lesson once a week and 1.5 hour band practice), guitar lesson at our house on Sundays, and occasional Art classes.  We participate in carpools, but should not be away from the house for more than 2 hours, and plan to bring the puppy with us whenever possible.  Both vehicles can accommodate a crate without a problem.  We will have house guests as our family lives in other parts of the country but visit frequently.   Our summer is pretty laid back with some traveling. My husband is a pilot for United Airlines, and plans to contact the chief pilot to find out about airplane travel with the puppy as we would like to bring it with us when it's old enough.  We were planning on going to Seattle to visit family for Christmas, but if the puppy isn't old enough to join us we will postpone until it is.  Next summer (July) we have an extended family reunion/heritage trip to Sweden and Prague with my husband's family for 10-12 days.  The primary caregiver will be me, with the help of my daughters when they are home. I have one concern that I discussed with Theresa Camloh and she thought it would be worked out:   1.  We have 3 rescue cats that I believe will be ok when we  bring a new puppy into the home after a transition period (one will be aloof, one will be best buds, and one may stay upstairs for the 18 months because she is afraid of her own shadow but desperately wants to be pet), but it may be difficult to bring a new puppy into our home quarterly because of the transition period of them accepting a new family member.     We are very excited to be part of the Guiding Eyes Program :)"

Come back home and begin my work day from my home office.  Leave around 2:30pm to pick my daughter up from school.  Come back home finish out my work day and then get dinner ready.  Our weekend schedules vary depending on the fun activities and chores that have to happen.  I have much flexibility during my week and weekend schedules because of working from home.    I would write you a novel if my life was that wonderfully complicated, but it isn't.  I choose a simple life: family first, work, and fun.  We do go camping in a travel trailer and would definitely take the puppy with us on any weekend camping trips. "

We leave for work by 7:30 on weekdays. Kathy works a mile from home and can take lunch at home. Kathy also can be home by 3:15 to drop Alli off from school to attend to the puppy. Our daughter Alli is soon to be 16 and is going to be an integral part of the puppy raising. Zach, our oldest leaves for college in the fall and is looking forward to helping when he is home. I work for Verizon and often pass through town and can stop for a quick check and bathroom time. There is always someone home from 3:30 in the afternoon till morning. Our weekends are extremely flexible with occasional trips to parade and fire dept functions. This will be an excellent opportunity for socialization when the puppy is ready. Kathy is a teacher and class adviser which will allow the pup to attend many different social environments through school. Wes is a county fire coordinator and would be able to take the pup to meetings and expose the pup to another experience. Our extended family also has many animals to expose the pup to. (cows,goats,rabbits,cat,chickens,horses) We have had three previous dogs as pets. A golden retriever,beagle and a dalmatian. The dalmatian was trained and proficient enough to march in the parades with Wes off leash and was a real crowd favorite. We have had a relationship with our Vet for over twenty years and find them very caring and willing to make emergency calls if necessary. We look forward to learning and being able to help teach a puppy to become someones guiding eyes.Thank you for your time."

They were both Bouviers that we raised from pups.  We rescued two other dogs in later years. One was a puppy and one was a five year old.      At the current time, our typical day includes a two mile walk, some exercises at home, e.g. push ups. planks, squats, lunges etc., some household chores and some minor yard maintenance.  On many days we run personal errands and do some light shopping, reading and watch sporting events in the evening.  We currently expect to be doing some small home improvement projects and minor repairs in our home.    We also take periodic dance and cooking lessons at present.  I also work as a financial advisor for a handful of clients.  I do almost all of that work in my home office. In addition, I do volunteer work for the local library as a Trustee which requires short periodic meetings and some additional work from home totally about 2-8 hours weekly.

The back yard has some fencing but is not completely closed off. My husband and I have always had dogs, but when our son Pete was born we discovered he had asthma. This is why we did not adopt again when our dogs passed away. Pete has since outgrown his asthma and we are more than ready to begin raising a dog again. I am a physical therapist and presently work on a per diem basis. I am also taking online classes to earn my Masters in Orientation and Mobility, therefore I am often home studying.  Pete finishes school June 19th and will be a freshman in the fall. He plays baseball 3-4 times per week throughout the summer, but otherwise is usually home. After June 19th, someone will always be home.  I am taking 2 online classes this summer therefore we are unable to go on a long vacation, however we hope to take a day/overnight trips occasionally. Because we have not had a dog in years, we would love a mild mannered puppy (if possible) to begin our puppy raising experience.

Jim usually leaves the home around 7am and returns around 530pm.  Our daughter Kelley will be returning home on May 29 after a year of teaching in Micronesia.  She will be going to graduate school in Massachusetts the end of August.  Our son Scott lives outside of Denver and gets home several times a year.

We also have great neighbors.      We travel to see our son but mostly for long weekends and will be thrilled to have our daughter back on US soil. I enjoy cooking and Jim does the grilling. We are usually home every night. I attend a monthly book club and Bunco group in the neighborhood. We have season tickets to Shea's for a night out. Jim is an avid hiker and rides bikes for numerous charities.  We are both active with no health issues.     We prefer a male puppy and don't have a preference though my brother and Jim's sister have Labs.  I did grow up with German Shepards. We feel that Pierre is easy to get along with and when we visit my brother all the dogs do play together. I do have a large crate that we use for our boxer which is in the basement at this time.

Once again I am within 5-10 minutes from home.

I am very much a homebody and enjoy gardening, bike riding and walking, hiking in the summer and reading, cooking and baking in the winter, hence the 20lb gain from our past fabulous WNY winter.   My 20 year old daughter is home from school for the summer and works at our complex as a lifeguard.  She is attending a local college and is studying Animal Behavior and Ecology Conservation.  She is very excited about this opportunity to raise a puppy for a visually impaired person, a child or some other alternative career.  We have never had a puppy or dog as this is something I did not want to even attempt without having the proper training to be a successful and responsible dog guardian.  I thought this would be a fabulous experience for both of us and give us a taste of being responsible puppy/dog lovers and owners for the benefit of someone in need.  We are animal lovers but have always been cat people and let's be honest, it doesn't take much to be a good cat caretaker.  We currently have two house cats that do not go outside.  They are both spayed females.  Pixie is a year and a half and Belle is going to turn 4 on July 7th.  They have a love hate relationship and both sleep on purr pads on my bed (this is the love part) or in their cat tree.

My current dog loves to play with other dogs and I think will be a big help in socializing the guiding eyes dog, too. "
184,Primary,27694,0,Ohio,4K15,Karalee,19872,03/28/15,"My typical day looks different depending on whether I am working from home or on location. I work for a company based in Encino, California and as a consultant, usually travel 1-3 times per month for 2-3 days each time to out-of-state locations to meet with my clients. During these trips, I plan on utilizing approved puppy sitters and my family, who will be co-raising with me.    When I am working from home (majority of the time), my day is almost 100% flexible. My day starts out around 8AM with playtime with my family pet (Annie - 7 year old female yellow lab), followed by breakfast, showering, and reading/devotional time. Afterwards, I usually spend 1-2 hours on the phone throughout the day and anywhere from 2-6 hours doing computer work - again, very flexible. In the evenings I enjoy cooking dinner, going to the gym, spending time with family, watching tv, playing with our family dog, visiting my nephews or cousins, and relaxing.    On the weekends I go to Zumba, church, and may run errands for the week including the grocery store, dry cleaning, etc. I will spend time with my sisters and friends, may travel to a nearby town or city for a day of exploring or bike riding, camp out in a library or unique bookstore to explore, enjoy a barbecue and bonfire with family, go to a concert, or spend the day playing with our pup. My weekend are always flexible and include both relaxation/downtime and lots of socialization.     I am moving (in April) to a 2-bedroom first-floor condo in a tree-filled area near a national park, which I anticipate hiking and exploring in my free time. The puppy will have many nearby opportunities for socialization and though the condo itself is secluded, it is nearby sidewalks, parks, shops, etc. We will also spend time at my parents' home (about 20 minutes from where I will be living), playing out in the huge private yard with our pup Annie. Both my parents have participated in dog training before and plan on participating in Guiding Eyes training as well.    A great match for me would be a puppy who will be (or grow to be) very comfortable around small children (I have two young nephews and many young cousins) and our lab Annie, enjoys activity (hiking, walking) but with a calm temperament. Once approved for travel, my puppy will be able to accompany me on business travel, so a pup with a temperament for travel and being around new faces often would be a good match as well. "

My husband works full-time and late hours, therefore Jenna and I will be primarily raising the puppy. A typical day begins with us waking at 7:30am. Shower, dress, breakfast and then off to school at 8:40am. While Jenna is in school, I run errands (with the future puppy) and I study for my Graduate Record Examination (which I should be taking in August 2015). At 3:45 pm, Jenna's bus arrives to the bus stop in front of our house. On Wednesday's, Jenna has a piano lesson at 4:45pm (which I could take the puppy to) On Wednesday's, Jenna stays later at school for Spanish Class. I pick her up at 4:25pm, (which I could also take the puppy to as well.) Our schedule is generally flexible at this point in our lives as I am not working at the moment. We haven't figured out or summer schedule yet, but I anticipate Jenna will be in a weekly summer camp. My schedule will more or less stay the same. On weekends, we spend family time together and like to do outdoor activities and have gatherings with our friends, who have kids Jenna's age and younger.   We live in a single family home in Edgewater, in a neighborhood that is full of young families and VERY dog friendly. We travel a few times a year to our family house in Florida, usually around Thanksgiving and Christmas, and once during the summer, the date TBD. I'm not sure at this time is we would be taking the puppy with us, or if we would leave it with a Guiding Eyes Sitter.  Jenna is a wonderful little girl who adores animals, is super intelligent and very excited to learn.    We strongly prefer a girl puppy. I've had experience with smaller dogs, but for my husband and Jenna, this will be their first experience. We have a fluffy white cat names Odette who is wary of strangers, but very sweet with us. "

I am an outgoing and active person. I tend to get excited around animals. I love being outside and going for walks. This summer I will be working at a group home in Fall River MA from 7:30 am - 3:30 pm on weekdays. I don't usually go on vacations and tend to stay home on weekends through out the year unless I have to do something for a class or work. At home I have a 7 year old low energy chihuahua.

My family and i have soft spots for big dogs, especially German Shepherds. "
161,Primary,27665,0,Maine,3M15,Mac,19899,04/22/15,"My day begins around 6:30 I wake up shower, get dressed, and get ready. I either go to work (office assistant job at a desk (boss already approved of dog in office), or I go to class (approval would need to be received from class and professor before dog was brought in). I walk to both places as they are on campus.     I am usually out of my room until lunch at 11-12:30 I usually head back to my room (next year I will be living in an on campus residence hall suite I will have my own bedroom, my own bathroom, and my own common room) I am an RA so this lunch period sometimes involves having residential peer counseling sessions, but often times I can sit and get started on some homework, take a nap or Netflix break as well.     Then I usually have class in the afternoon classes and afternoon meeting can run back to back or have breaks in between where I head back to my room for periods of 30 minutes to an hour. or I go to the gym or for a quick walk before my next class/ meeting.      I usually eat my dinner between 4:30-7:00 its a large window but my evening changes depending on which classes I have. sometimes I skip the campus meal and order delivery to my room.   I stay up until 11:30 most nights doing homework, hosting floor or campus programs, peer counseling, or just hanging out with friends on rare occasions I go to the weight room at night (sometimes it is less crowded then), But mostly to exercise I go for walks up the road that goes though campus and walk up past farm lands during the evening hours because its when I have the most free time so I can walk until I get tired.     About 11 nights each semester I am on Duty for Residence Life. This means myself and one other RA walk around the campus residence halls twice a night at 7:00 and 10:00 on weekdays and three times a night 7:00, 10:00 and 1:00 on weekends to make sure all the residence are safe and following the rules and regulations of the campus. During these nights I would not bring the dog with me because some situations would be hard to handle while training a dog. The dog would either stay in its crate while I go on these rounds (each set takes approximately 30 min if there are no problems) or I would have the dog stay with the co-raiser or sitters.     Most weekends I am on campus because I try to maintain a presence as Resident Advisor for my floor, but we are advised through the reslife position to take a few weekends off throughout the year to give ourselves a break from our 24/7 job.     Which leads me to this, I can make a perfect schedule but I know that it wont be followed to a T because my residents will have crisis's that they need me for this can be minor crises (breakups, cuts, roommate disagreements) or they can be major crises (suicides, physical attacks, drugs/alcohol, seizures and other medical emergency's) I am usually their first call, this being said I have training to handle all of this and be able to prioritize and make sure everyone including the puppy is safe, and cared for. In minor situations the puppy would most likely stay with me, in major crisis I would most likely contact my GEB team to assist with the puppy or contact my RA staff to assist with the residents.     Overall my day as a college student is scattered due to class periods and schedule meal times but those scattered periods become a standardized schedule every year that I modify my lifestyle to fit. At the beginning of next year my GEB Co raisers and sitters are planning on sharing our schedules so we can cooperate when we each will have the puppy and make sure that someone is always available to care for it.  Below I have written my class schedule for next semester but it might change during the first few weeks of school and My work schedule has not been determined yet.

There are three humans and 2 dogs in our home.  I, Michelle, work from 8:30-5:00 Monday through Friday (from home). Although my job is busy, I have the ability to intermittently address concerns around the home (i.e. letting the dogs in and out, feeding the dogs, doing some laundry).  Prior to work I try to ""set up"" for the day by preparing dinner, doing laundry, cleaning up the house, and working out.    Joe, my husband is home all day long as well. Because of an illness he has, he tends not to leave the house for extended periods of time. He is generally home for most of the day and is able to tend to the pets and drop off/pick up our daughter from school. He performs ""light duty"" around the home.  Our daughter Katie is 11 years old and in the sixth grade. Her school is very close to our home (within 2 miles). When she is not in school she spends much of her time playing with our 2 Jack Russell Terriers and doing gymnastics.  We live on a quiet cul-de-sac with sidewalks and we have neighbors who pop in from time to time to visit.    Our dogs, Ginger and Daphne are 5 years old. They are sisters and are very loveable and playful.  They love being outdoors and playing in our large fenced yard.  They often get exercised with us as well as we bring them walking or running in the neighborhood or in the field behind our neighbor's house.  Additionally, we have a camp in Speculator, NY where we go frequently in the summer. Many of the people on the private campground where we stay are friends of ours.  Weekends are very low key. We generally stay around the house and run a few errands here and there. We routinely attend church on Sundays which is right next door.  We feel that we will be successful with puppy raising because we love dogs and we have a lifestyle that is conducive to providing a puppy with lots of opportunities to interact and learn throughout each and every day.

We have had our cat since she was a kitten (she is 1 now), and she has never been around dogs. I am a full-time teacher with Mary Cariola Children's Center. On weekdays I am gone approximately 8-10 hours for work. Chris works as part-time EMT (mostly overtnights) and is a volunteer firefighter. He is also a full-time student at FLCC. He currently only has classes on Tuesday and Thursday, and is gone for approximately 8-10 hours on the days he has class. I am an early riser, and am typically awake 2.5-3  hours before I need to leave the house for work. I tend to catch up on work or watch TV/drink coffee during this time. Chris is not a morning person. On days that Chris does not have school, he spends his time doing homework, running errands, doing housework, or hanging out at the fire station. Our evenings consist of making dinner and relaxing. I tend to go to bed relatively early on weekdays, but Chris is usually up later. Most sof Chris' work shifts are in the evenings until midnight, or they don't start until midnight, which means he is awake during strange hours. On the weekends we attend church, spend time with family/friends, and just generally relax. We are a relatively relaxed family. Outside of work/school, we don't tend to be in a rush to do anything. A quick visit to my parents' house can easily become a visit lasting a few hours, it just depends on our moods. Most of our outings are low-key. When we spend time with friends, we are typically hanging out at someone's house or going to a restaurant. We enjoy playing board/card games, reading, and watching TV.

191,Primary,27572,0,Eastern MA,4H15,Hobbs,19851,03/20/15,"My name is Mae Kovacs. I have lived in Massachusetts my whole life with my mom, Deb Kovacs, my dad, Chris Kovacs, and my younger sister, Amelia Kovacs. I am very excited to be starting this amazing process with Guiding Eyes for the Blind. I am a sophomore at Groton Dunstable Regional High School. Currently, I am competing in outdoor track and field for the high school. Track is my only sport; I have elected not to play fall soccer if I am accepted to be a puppy raiser.     This summer, I will not be working in order to devote as much of my free time as I can to the puppy. I will be free after school in the fall and winter as well. I am hoping to take on the role of the primary raiser for the puppy. I feel that I am responsible enough to care for a dog with the help of my family. I know that this is a great opportunity to help somebody else, and I want to be a large part of that.    My typical weekday during the track season (now through the end of May) is busy but manageable. I wake up around 5:00 a.m. every morning and get dressed, pack my bag, make my lunch, and get all ready for school. The bus picks me up around 6:40 and I arrive at school around 7:00. I finish school at 1:50 and go straight to track practice from 2:30-4:30. I arrive home around 4:45 and go to bed around 11:00. I realize that this schedule will mean I am away from home for most of the day, but it will last only about the next 9-10 weeks. My family is more than happy to help for the month when track and field and the puppy raising will coincide. My mom works part time and is planning to take a couple days off from work in order to spend more time with the puppy. My dad works from home and is happy to let the puppy outside frequently during the day so that it can eliminate.     I realize that for the first twelve weeks, the puppy classes will be held every Saturday. I know that the puppy takes precedence over almost everything, however, because the process is starting a little earlier than I expected, I have three dates that I may not be able to make the entire class. These three track meets are mandatory. The District Relays track meet is on May 2nd and it starts at 1 o‚Äôclock. The Division track meet is on May 30th at 1 o‚Äôclock. If I perform very well at the Division meet, I will qualify for the All State track meet on June 6th. Besides these track meets and SAT‚Äôs the following spring, I have cleared every Saturday for the next year and a half. My Mom will be able to attend all of these classes.    I end school in mid June and start up again in late August. The summer is my most flexible time of the year; I have enough time to spend many hours a day with the puppy. I will also be receiving my driver‚Äôs license in July, which will allow me to do the majority of the transportation for the puppy.      In the fall, my weekdays will consist of school. I will be able to come home and care for the puppy around 2:00 every afternoon. In the winter, I will have a very similar schedule to the fall. My family normally has very free weekends. On Saturday nights we sometimes enjoy going to the mall, out to dinner, the movies, etc. During the summer and fall, we love to spend time outside and in Cape Cod. We have one dog already, a ten-year-old black lab. He is well trained and very loyal. We have a cat that is tolerant of him as well as twenty chickens.     In general, I like to take on new experiences. I attended Outward Bound 2 years in a row, which involved intense hiking and paddling, rock climbing, and a mentally challenging 2 day solo experience. I traveled on my own to and from California, finding my way through the airport to the meeting place. I have refereed soccer games for several towns over the past 3 years, learning to deal with kids and adults in high-pressure situations. I feel that I have confidence, patience and leadership skills. I absolutely love animals, and am definitely a ‚Äúdog person.‚Äù The training program of GEB is appealing, and I am ready to learn and apply my new skills with a pup. I already love spending time with my pooch, walking him and playing with him daily. I am determined to make this project work for the new pup, whose success depends on me being consistent and available for its care and training. By teaming up with my mom and coordinating our schedules, I know we can make this a successful experience for a new pup.   "

Kids are in school unitl 3pm. My older brother works second shift and gets up about 9-930 and will be home until 2pm. After school I have swim practice until 6 but my younger brother gets home from school about 320. In spring and fall my younger brother runs track and xc, I swim in winter months and otherwise I am home alot. My older sister is away at college and occasionally comes home on weekends and breaks. My dad gets home about 6 and on the days my mom works, she gets home about 830pm. She only works three days a week so will be around to help with puppy on her days off. We are usually up until about 10-1030pm. Swim will be over the middle of March and I will then get home about 3pm each day. On weekends it depends on when my meets are, but they ususally last 2-4 hrs on Saturdays. One or more of my brothers would be here on the weekends. On Sundays we are all usually home. We are usually home alot when not at work or school and like to hike with our dogs in local parks. We live in a rural part of Munson, 6-7 miles south of Chardon, in a neighborhood on a cul de sac-its about 1/2 mile to the end. Our house sits back from the road and is surrounded by trees in the back yard. Our driveway is about 1/4 mile long and our front yard is large and has alot of hills and gardens with trees around the edge. We have two large dogs, an Aussie and a lab/great dane mix and both are pretty mellow. We also have five cats who have always lived with dogs and usually dont bother with them. Our house is a cape with an open kitchen living room area and a dining room and the bedrooms are upstairs and down. We plan to gate off the kitchen/mudroom until the puppy is more comfortable. We have two dog crates, one large wire one and a smaller plastic one that would work for car rides. We dont travel much, usually a week or two in the summer for vacation and occasional day trips locally. We do sometimes go camping in summertime."

However the only time the puppy will be alone would be from 10-11 and 12-2:30 on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Our weekend is pretty free especially in the spring, summer, and fall. Kayla will be out of school in the summer too so the puppy won't be left alone at all. "

I am self-employed and do bookkeeping and event planning for associations and businesses that are too small to need anyone full time in that role, so most of my work is on the computer.  I have some clients that I do all of their work out of my home office and others that I go to monthly or bimonthly for 2-3 hours.  I also do a lot of quick runs to other offices just to pick up/drop off things that I needed to prepare that client's items.      My schedule for location varies each week, but I tend to working at home in the morning most days and work in client offices 2-3 times a week in the afternoon.  I sometimes usually do a couple of hours of admin work for myself on weekends at some point and occasional schedule a client for Saturday if that fits the client's schedule better.  Generally go out to dinner with friends a couple of times a week.  I have been trying to stay in the habit of walking every morning, but it is harder without a dog to remind you on days the weather isn't as cooperative!  My schedule is generally very flexible, though there are generally a couple of meetings each month that I are have to attend that are set by others and I try to take a weekly yoga class at some point."

My job is to go into adult homes in Sullivan County and ensure the well being of the residents.  I report monthly to Hands on the Hudson who in turn report to Dept. Of Health.  This is a very, very flexible position I go when I choose as I have 24/7 access to the facilities.  So being home all the time is not a problem.  I will do it evenings when my husband is home or weekends.  We live outside of Monticello in the Town of Thompson in a rural community.  (8 houses down the street, if you can call that a community).  We lead a quiet life especially in the winter.  Summer we find places to go to walk, hike usually upstate.   My husband and I have had dogs all of our 32 years together.  From pure bred Huskie to lab/mixes.  Always big dogs 90lbs/plus.  Our most recent 2 dogs died in 2012.  They were our hearts and we were devastated when they died.  Swore we would never have anymore. When  we saw the Sullivan County Democrat article and write up about Guiding Eyes.  We discussed it and I went to your orientation meeting.  Decide that I wanted to be a part of this.  A few friends I have spoken to regard this have all asked the same question ""Will you be able to give the dog back"".  My answer is ""Yes, I am a temporary ""mom"" .Even though I know my heart will hurt the day he/or she leaves  I know that I will feel honored to have been a part of raising a puppy that will go on to do amazing things for a visually impaired person or an autistic child."

244,Primary,27371,0,Sullivan,1D414,Dania,19684,01/10/15,"I am currently 69 years young and am a retired well driller and pump installer who occasionally will repair water pumps!  My home is located in a rural and quiet area of Livingston Manor, three miles from town, on a dead end street.  We have one pair of neighbors who live nearby year round, but there home is out of view.  We have three other sets of neighbors who visit their homes several times throughout the year.  My day begins around 5 am when my wife, Kathleen, wakes to get ready for work.  I wake up then too to prepare her breakfast and gourmet lunch!  She's a very lucky woman!  We read the paper - well I do Sudoku and she reads the paper.  We have breakfast together and my wife leaves for work around 7 am. After a 2nd cup of coffee, during the winter months, I head outside to feed the visiting birds.  In the warmer months, I usually head outside to mow the lawn, do yard work, work on our vegetable garden.  I love to be outdoors as often as possible!  After lunch, I often head into town to get groceries, pick up mail, run errands, etc.  This takes about one hour or two.  I'm usually home by 3pm for a cup of coffee or green tea!  Kathleen usually arrives home anywhere from 4 to 5:30 pm, depending on whether she has meetings after work or not.  If the weather is cooperative, we often take a 20-minute walk down our quiet road to catch up on our day!  We have dinner at 6pm each evening - usually in the living room - while watching the news.  After the news, we watch Jeopardy until 7:30!  We then might chat with family members on the phone, watch additional television or catch up on paperwork.  Weekends are spent relaxing or visiting family or special events!  In late spring and throughout the summer, I usually play in a golf league on Monday nights.  Due to ongoing back issues, I don't believe I will continue to play in the league this year.  However, the back issues should not prevent me from becoming a puppy raiser.  This summer, Kathleen & I have two big events occurring.  One, is that we plan to travel to Ireland for two weeks to visit her parents and help her Mom celebrate her 80th birthday!  We also plan to put up a modular home right behind our current home.  The intention is that once the modular is up and ready for us to move in, we will then 'tear down' our former home.  We will continue to live at the same location and address.  So these will be two exciting events happening this year.  Kathleen & I are the only two people living at home.  We both have adult children from previous marriages.  We also have two grandchildren, ages 11 and 6.  Our 11-year-old granddaughter, Madison, lives in Central Valley and we only see her about 4-5 times throughout the year - mostly visiting her in Central Valley.  Madison lives with her Mom, a golden retriever, and 3 house cats.  Our other grandchild, is a boy.  Kaleb is 6-years old and he lives 5 miles away and we usually see him every Sunday.  Kaleb lives with his Mom and two small dogs, Diggy - who is a Jack Russell Terrier, and Maverick - a Chihuahua.  Usually Kaleb and his Mom visit us without their two dogs.  In my lifetime, I have had several pet dogs from the time I was a young boy up until 2 years ago, when Kathleen & I lost our last pet, Keiko to cancer.  Keiko was an American Eskimo dog and we had the good fortune of having him in our lives for 10 years.  My personality is very calm and patient and I love most animals, but I'm partial to dogs.   We both look forward to having another dog in our home and know that he will be in good and loving care when placed with us.  We also look forward to working with Nicole and becoming a part of the Guiding Eyes for the Blind community!"

We arrive home at 3:30 and relax for a few minuted with our dogs.  We usually feed the dogs at 4:30 then take them on another walk.  we have the dogs relax with us while we fix our evening meal and eat.  we them spend some doggie time before watching television or relaxing in the evening.  We will then take the dogs oustide before bedtime.

The kids have an active schedule of lessons and athletic activities (they are swimmers.)  Most nights one parent is home while the other chases children who have a fairly set schedule of activities (dance Tuesday nights, swimming most nights).  Most weekends we are home, and we don't travel much.  We enjoy the fact that weekends are less busy.   We like to hike/bike and swim.  In the summer we belong to the Edison club and swim on the swim team.  We also take a regular 2 week family vacation in the summer.  We don't have a fenced in yard, but we do live in a neighborhood with large yards.   At this point, we don't forsee any job changes or moves in the forseeable future."

My schedule is still flexible at this point. I will graduate in May, and plan to commute to a 4 year school in Fall 2015. I wake up at about 6:30-7:00am, to go to school or work, and am home no later than 5pm. I can come home mid-day to walk the pup. I usually run errands or relax at home after school, and go to sleep around 11pm.  I am a nanny to a 4 year-old girl and 2 year-old boy from 7:30am to 4:30pm, usually every Wednesday and occasional Mondays and Fridays. They have a 5 month-old, male Rottweiler puppy that I walk and feed mid-day sometimes. They will allow me to bring the pup for the first few months. I sometimes babysit Saturday afternoons for a family with 2 year-old twin boys and a 4 year-old girl. My work schedule is very flexible. It sounds very complicated, but really is not.  I live in a single-family home on 3/4 of an acre. We have an above ground pool which has a locked ladder when not in use. We live on a quiet street, but have railroad tracks across the street and a firehouse nearby. We live very close to a few parks and walking trails, as well as our emergency vet. We have 4 fixed cats, all up-to-date on vet care and shots. But a pup that doesn't chase would be best.   We don't travel much, and if we do, it is for no longer than a week and never out of the country. I'm extremely excited about raising my first GEB pup and am willing to give 100% to ensure his/her success. I'm a rule-follower (just ask my family- they call me ""by-the-book-cook!""). I can't wait to meet my pup and start our journey together!"

I live by myself in my home.  I have a small fenced in area but would always supervise while in that area. I have an amazing Miniature Australian Shepherd that I trained myself. My dog was trained very similar to you training methods.  She is incredibly well behaved under any situation and any where I take her.  I recently took an agility class with her so I an also familiar with luring/marking and thin slices. I go to church every Sunday and already have permission to bring the puppy with me.  I am also the Secretary of our Draft Horse Club and a member of the Bridgewater Grange and will be taking the puppy to those meetings/events. I usually rent a home in the Cape for vacation in the summer with my kids so I would be able to bring on vacation with me. My son owns a home right behind mine so he would be available if I ever had the need to have someone feed or walk the dog.  All of my friends love dogs and would love to have my bring the dog to their homes when visiting.

My schedule is extremely flexible due to the amount of work and the fact that the nature of my work involves different times of the day.  My favorite activity involves approximately an hour or two at a local gym.  I am in general good health and have no physical restrictions despite my 64 years of age.  My wife is a fully retired school teacher (she will weigh in on her own quiz).  We reside in on seven acres of lawn and woods.  We have a two story colonial residence with a finished basement.  Our driveway is 400 feet on a secondary road.  We had our lab on this property for approximately five years.  We did not allow Lucy to leave the house without being leashed.    We have two grown sons.  One in Seattle and the other in Washington D.C.  The son in DC has a 10-12 year old rescue beagle that has been a member of his family for two years.  They occasionally visit or we travel to DC to visit.  No other animals are in our immediate family.  My wife and I have raised two dogs in the course of our 42 year marriage.  A Great Dane before our children arrived and a black lab was with us for 12 years and passed away 10 years ago.  We are extremely partial to labs.  We have nieces and nephews that have had or have labs. Our daughter in law's family has a chocolate lab.  There are no grandchildren.  We have extended family with grand children from teenagers to toddlers however rarely, except for holidays or special occasions are they regular visitors.      As stated in our introductory application, we have considered this relationship for some time.  Given our reduced commitments at this stage in our lives we felt this would be an ideal time to focus on this extraordinary opportunity.  Although, we would like to travel to a warm climate for a few weeks during the winter we have not begun that process in our relatively new retirement lives.

I do my homework after relaxing for a while and it usually takes around 1-2 hours, sometimes more. In my free time I like to watch movies, go for walks near the beach, go to the gym, or hangout with friends. I shower, eat, and am usually in bed around 11. On the weekends I spend time with friends and enjoy being able to sleep in. On weekdays and weekends I have plenty of spare time that will be devoted to my pup and am looking forward to this experience with much enthusiasm! I do have two other pets, a shy and reserved cat who is 12 years old and an 11 year old westie who is wonderful but at times dominant with other dogs (even big dogs). My only concern is how my current dog with interact with the new pup; I don't want either dog to feel at all threatened. "

I am an avid gardener, so except for the winter months, I am often outside in the yard digging, laying mulch, planting, etc.  We are fairly active.  I walk for my main exercise.  I also enjoy small hikes around our area, exploring new towns and in the summer, going to the beach.  Beach days we are usually gone for long hours, but I have friends/neighbors who would be able to let the dog out.  We had a dog for 14 years and took him on many of our travels.  We often say that our dog visited more states than some of our kids. We tend to drive long distances and he went with us and stayed in dog-friendly hotels. "

I am a stay at home mom of three girls 10,12 and 13yrs. We are in walking distance to school so I often walk the youngest to school and pick her up at the end of the day. I generally work out in the morning after the girls have gone to school and love to walk around the hilly bronxville streets. I love to walk to the store or into town, not so keen on driving. We have an apartment on a lake in Connecticut that we spend a lot of time at in the summer. This is a community that caters for and allows dogs. Also during the summer we like to take a trip to Europe to visit family, both my husband and myself are from England but have lived in the states for 15yrs. We do love to travel and like to make the most of the girls school vacation time. At the moment however we have nothing booked for thanksgiving, or Christmas, just have family visiting us. We are however planning to go away for Presidents week and Easter.  I am a qualified Dentist but I am unable to work in the states. When we first moved to the states I worked at the anti cruelty society in Chicago, generally cleaning animals ear, nail clipping and the odd tooth extraction. This I loved but had to give up when I became pregnant because of the risk of toxoplasmosis.  I also volunteered at a vets in England throughout high school with the hopes of studying veterinary surgery, which alas did not happen. I had a dog growing up and then cats when I was at college, I have a lot of time and patience for animals.

277,Primary,27224,0,Westchester,2K314,Keeper,19548,11/09/14,"OK, I'll try to get as much pertinent detail in here as I can without having it get boring on you.  Hope it works!      I'll start by saying that a lifestyle change is a definite possibility in the foreseeable future.  I am currently out of work and seeking employment.  I am a finance professional, which in this case means a couple things.  1. It may still be a while before I can get back to work.   2. Any work that I find would likely be in NYC, or southern CT, resulting in a commuting lifestyle.    3. The area of finance that I am in typically does not require really excessive hours except in unusual circumstances, so while a new job would mark a change in lifestyle for both me and a pup, it shouldn't be a change that prevented me from providing the proper care, enrichment, and training that the pups need.     In any case, all of that is speculative.  Right now, my lifestyle consists primarily of my ongoing job search and a variety of hobbies.  On a typical day, I will spend up to several hours searching for a job, half an hour working out at home, then add in some time spent on anything from trying to improve my Egyptian Arabic, dancing tango, or, weather and company depending, fly fishing, or squash.  This is aside from visits with friends and family.  As things stand, my entire schedule is rather flexible and my weekends differ little from my weekdays.      I live alone on the first floor of a two family house and have sole use of the basement as well.  The property includes a pretty generous back yard for outside play as well.  I am 31 and physically fit, so the physical aspect of working with a puppy (small or large) does not present a concern.   I do have a six year old cat, who has had some exposure to dogs and sort of likes to play with them unless they get too close or too aggressive.  He's never had a dog stay in the house for more than a month or so at a time.  I have a very close knit family, so multiple family members are very close by (and several are neighbors), in addition to my girlfriend who is following along with the GEB curriculum and policies and wants to be involved in helping out.   There are multiple dogs nearby in the family, all small, but also all very poor socialization, house manners, and ""people skills"".  The main things I want to make sure that GEB is able to work with me to get right are: socializing with other dogs (should the puppy be exposed to the poor untrained above mentioned dogs or avoid them to prevent being peer pressured into poor behavior?) and puppy proofing the house, in particular the basement (where the cat's litter is.)  Otherwise, the potential lifestyle change of a new job is the only item that could present a challenge.  I'm not certain what other information would be helpful for you, but would be very happy to discuss anything else you might like.    Oh, and question 4, regarding class schedules...  I didn't see the precise information on this, but I had been told six months of weekly and the remainder every other week.  Either way is fine as more training is better, in my mind.      P.S.    If GEB has a means of accomplishing the lottery ticket training mentioned in question 6, it could provide a great source of funding for the program as well as a nice bonus for puppy raisers during the training process!"

We rise at 5:30 am and walk our current Australian Labradoodle (mini) Hannah Grace at this time for 45 minutes to an hour around downtown Westport. I leave the house at 7:15, my husband leaves the house at 8:00 am. I can arrive home for lunch at 11:00 a.m. (This is flexible, as I have someone who can let the dog out with some play time midday) Following my workday, I typically arrive home at 3:10 and on some days run errands with Hannah Grace who is  quite good in the car and settles when waiting between errands. I might visit the library or the gym or grocery store or visit a friend. We eat dinner between 5:30 and 6:30 typically. I attend Book Club once a week on Wednesdays and Guide Dog Training on Thursdays. On the weekends, we continue our morning walks in addition to a Sunday morning beach walk at Compo Beach in Westport where dogs are allowed off-leash in the off-season. I tutor a student twice a month who is fearful of dogs. Hannah Grace attends the session with me. In the summer, I co-teach a Literacy for Dog Lovers camp session at my home for 8-10 children (grades 1-6) for mornings over the course of two weeks. There are visiting dogs and guest speakers (Guiding Eyes!). The purpose of the camp is to help children develop their knowledge of dogs and understand the relationship they can have with a dog. Some children are fearful of dogs, are recent puppy owners, or are planning to get a puppy. Some of the children are special needs children. Hannah Grace is a Therapy Dog registered with the Good Dog Foundation and is scheduled to attend Read to Rover as well as anticipated visits to Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan.   We are very flexible on our weekends, usually hanging around the house and engaging in yardwork, gardening, and beachwalking . Our son who has Downs Syndrome lives with two roommates independently in Norwalk and we usually visit at some point over the weekend and bring the dog as they are dog lovers. We have raised 6 Golden Retrievers in addition to Hannah Grace, the last of whom passed on a year ago.   We live in  a house, within walking distance to town, that has a small fenced in area in the backyard behind the garden and patio. We do not take our dogs to the front yard and they are not allowed outdoors alone. We have many friends with nice dogs and periodically will have one stay with us overnight. (Golden Retriever, Australian Shepherd, larger Australian Labradoodle.)  We will be going on a vacation for one week in March and a second week in August. We typically take our dog in August. We have  our youngest son in college currently, and our middle son lives locally, all dog lovers.   I am working currently to explore my next career passion, with the intention of it including dogs and children. (One of my main goals is to be able to bring my dog to my workplace!)

251,Primary,27192,0,South Western CT,4T314,Tango,19619,12/30/14,"CHAPTER 1: I am a lifelong animal lover and dogs have always had a staring role. I got my first dog Mike, an Irish Setter, when I was 14yrs old, after finding an add in the NYTimes. On Jun.13,1971 I hopped on a train from NYC to Woodmere L.I. with $200 (my life savings) and brought back what was to be a most remarkable dog, one that set the bar for all the dogs that followed.To give an example of one of his talents, he would accompany me on trips to the grocery store and then carry the package rolled up in a brown bag prancing with head held high until we reached our destination (several long city blocks). He accompanied me at college and was allowed to attend a class or two, occasionally carrying my books. CHAPTER 2 (Life style and other pertinent info):  I am an early riser and am usually up by 6:30 . I start my day with a cup of  tea and then walk my dog Luke . He is 14 years old and walks slowly so it takes ~15min to go around the block.I feed him and have my breakfast too and glance at the NYTimes. I am a substitute preschool teacher and get called sporadically.  The preschool is 5 min away from my house and the shifts are for 3-5 hours. My interests include cooking healthy meals ( I have a Masters degree in nutrition), outdoor activities, such as running, hiking, cycling and swimming (indoors in the winter), playing piano, and reading. I live within ~5-10min of both a beach and a wooded area that runs along the Mianus River and has a network of trails which are quite extensive . Both are great places to take a dog!  My schedule is fairly flexible. I spend a fair amount of time doing householdy things  like food shopping, cooking, and cleaning up. On weekends my husband Tyr and I might socialize with family or friends.We travel twice a year to California to visit his family and our eldest daughter, usually for a week.Some summers we might take a short trip to the Vineyard or Block Island.  Tyr is a busy surgeon and often works long hours.  I have 4 children who range in age from 19yrs - 29yrs in age  They are all in school or working. Three of them live nearby (actually one son is living at home but looking for an apt in NYC). Forgot to mention we have a black cat (Beena) who lives with us and get along with dogs who don't chase her.  She loves to follow us on walks with our dog. THE END (it's really late now)."
307,Primary,27162,0,Bay,8M314,Myrtle,19573,10/22/14,"While my entire family is fully prepared to assist in the care taking of the puppy, my son will be the primary care-taker. He is fully aware of the responsibilities he will need to take to proberly train and rasie the puppy. His schedule is completely flexible to a great degree. He is currently enrolled in community college but is only taking one class at this moment in time. The class is every Monday at 8:30 A.M and ends at 11:30 A.M and we leave in the morning at about 7:30. My son is currently not employed so for the rest of the week day he would be at home attending to the puppy. The only other my commitment my son has is Sunday School at our church, where he teaches Sunday School to 2nd & 3rd graders. The typical time period that we are there is around: 10:15 A.M - 12:00 P.M.    As for the eviorment the puppy would be livning in: We live in a three story house, with alot of stairs! We are located in a large develompent, but our house is backed up against the woods. And we also have a plump 5 year old cat who perfers to be left in solitude, I'd imagin the puppy will learn that quite quickly."

I do not work in the summertime. Steven is out of the house from 7 am until 11am during regular working hours. His hours are extended between Thanksgiving and Christmas but we have a neighbor who helps out with our cats when needed and she would be willing to let a young puppy out to get busy when necessary. Yes, we do have cats in our home. They are house cats and do not go outside. They have been exposed to dogs before. We have 2.8 acres of land and are 300 feet off the road in a fairly rural area. We are within 10 miles of a more urban area with sidewalks, traffic lights, a mall and several parks. On weekends, we enjoy outdoor activities including hiking, snowshoeing, swimming, boating,etc. Our children are in their early 20's and do not live with us.Our youngest son is close by at college and is excited to be involved in our venture.

313,Primary,27136,0,Southern CT,3F314,Farley,19498,10/17/14,We live in a small ranch house with a fenced in yard in a very close knit neighborhood. Street is very quiet - no one comes down unless you live there.   Our weekdays preety much consist of work and social obligations and fun. John gets up first and gets ready for work and when he leaves I basically start my day. He works in Milford which is about 15 miles away amd I work right in downtown New Haven which is less than five miles from my home. John gets home from work first in general and I some in about an hour later.   I have a very flexible work schedule and basically can come and go as I please.     Out nights vary.We both have varied social responsibilities. I belong to the Ladies Auxiliary for the East Haven fire department.   John and I both work with a project in Ecuador that helps build schools other things that make life better for our friends down there. We spend time fundraising here and are surrounded by many good people for these functions.   We also are two folks that love the water. We have a boat and enjoy spending time on it and at the marina just hanging out.     I have lived in the area fro my whole life where as John was in the military and travelled for many years. Since I have lived in the area I have many friends and family close by and people have asked me if I should install a revolving door as many people stop in to say hello. There is always coffee or tea on for guests and everyone is alway welcome at 83 Edgar Street!!
321,Primary,27134,0,Southern CT,5E314,Elijah,19489,10/13/14,"We share our home with a 7-year old feisty, female cat.  Hopefully, the cat will welcome a puppy into the household.  We have a single family home in an urban, high population density neighborhood with a goodly number of dogs.   I'm employed as a university professor.  This means my hours are long, however, other than my teaching and service commitments, I have a fair amount of flexibility in my schedule. My husband is a computer engineer.  He also works long hours, however, 3 days per week he works from home.  We predict our work situations will allow one of us to be available to the puppy at least every 4 hours.  Weekdays, I typically leave the house at 7:30 am to teach an 8:00 am class.  I have an 8 mile commute, so I anticipate I can come home mid-day to take the puppy out for a walk and training.  I am customarily home by 5 pm.    My husband works from home Wednesday through Friday.  Under most circumstances he can take 10-15 minute breaks periodically throughout the day to tend the puppy.  I am typically home on weekends and fill my time with household chores, hikes, bike rides, errands, as well as 3-10 hours of research and preparation for my teaching responsibilities.  On weekends my husband often is rehearsing or performing as a musician.  When he's home he also engages in household chores, yard work, hikes, bike rides, and he is a runner."
318,Primary,27133,0,Central CT,1I314,Ibbie,19521,10/15/14,"I am a stay at home mom with 3 children (ages 9 and two 6 yr olds). We get up between 6-7am and let our dog, Bella, out to potty and then get breakfast going. During the week, the kids get ready for school and I take them to school and drop them off. I come back home and begin my daily chores. I usually run in the morning, do household activities, walk our dog and then pick the kids up. They come home and do homework, we play or go to after school activities. If its the weekends, we relax, play games and go do family activities. We have very active children and we also have a family dog, Bella, our 10 yr old female golden retriever who is wonderful. She is very well behaved, loving and sweet. We would prefer a female puppy rather than a male puppy. Other than that, we are all very excited about this opportunity! Thank you!"
306,Primary,27098,0,Maine,7J314,Joyce,19536,10/25/14,"Typical day.  While there is lots of variety, a typical day includes time spent with my dogs including going for walks and ""throwing the ball"" in the yard, working on house projects, and working on cooking or needlework.  I live alone, except for the dogs, and usually have the television on, usually either the news or a CD of movies television programs.  I often can't tell the difference between a weekend and weekday day.    Work.  I'm retired from college admissions but I continue to work about three quarters time during January and part of February reading applications for Bowdoin College.  My work hours are completely flexible and the work is done at home on the computer.  I work best when I take frequent breaks while reading applications.    Volunteer work.  I volunteer at the Orr's Island Library.  I'm on duty for three hours about three to four times a month.  When appropriate the dog can accompany me and can be crated.  The dog is very welcome at the library.  I also attend monthly board meetings and about one other library event each month.    Renovating my old house.  I'm slowly making improvements to my house.  I don't do more than very basic plumbing or electrical work but I have redone floors and installed drywall, cabinets and countertops inside the house and replaced clapboards and painted outside.  While the list of projects is endless, I would say I am more than halfway finished with the major projects.  I fit this work into my life when I can and feel no pressure to finish on a schedule.  Having raised NEADS puppies for three years since retiring, I'm adept at keeping the puppy, and my dogs, safe during construction work (essentially they are never in the area where I'm working and I clean up carefully).  I also enjoy gardening and yard work.    Cooking and crafts.  I love cooking, needlework and other craft projects.  I do routine daily cooking for myself but also regularly enjoy baking and cooking for friends and family so a couple of times a month or more I'm spending the better part of a day or two in the kitchen.    My own dogs.  I have two neutered female labrador retrievers who are still quite lively at 9 and 11 years old.  They spend most of their time in my living room and have dog door access to a fenced in yard.  The fence is in need of some repair.  While it's safe for larger dogs, I don't give my dogs access to the yard when I'm not around.  Needless to say, a Guiding Eyes dog would never be in the yard without me. My dogs usually sleep with me but are comfortable sleeping in the living room.   I co-owned my younger lab with a breeder and she produced four litters including two game warden's search and rescue dogs (including Morgan who has appeared on ""North Woods Law""), one working NEADS dog and at least one therapy dog.  She is now neutered and was a great mother.   My older lab was intended to be a co-owned dog but had to be spayed during a cesarian the first time she was bred.  She is ball-obsessed and a sweetheart.    Time away from home. I don't have the money for much travel and did so much travel while working that I'm fine with mostly staying home.  I visit family in Maryland once a year and spend some time with friends in Maine.      House and neighborhood.  My house is an extended cape with a number of smaller rooms leaving lots of places to put a crate and lots of doorways for dog gates.  Orr's Island is a small community (bigger in the summer) with one local store that will be closing this winter.  In the town of Harpswell there are a number of other small stores.  I believe the only sidewalk is in front of the library but there are many side roads safe for walking.  It takes me 15 minutes to get to Cook's Corner where there is lots of shopping and 20 minutes to get to Brunswick with many opportunities for socialization.  Portland is 45 minutes from my home.  I go there to get my hair cut, to do some specialized shopping and for other activities.  I don't know Portland well but feel comfortable with the city.    NEADS.  I fostered a NEADS dog about 10 years ago while I was still working.  After retiring I returned to NEADS and have fostered four dogs, all of whom were bred by Guiding Eyes.  The first, Marv, will graduate in November.  The second, Ravyn, was dropped after being matched with a school teacher (for alert growling although this was very surprising given my experience with her) and the final two, Matty and Sasha, are doing well so far in their advanced training in prison.  I'm excited to continue working with helping dogs through Guiding Eyes and I'm becoming very aware of how Guiding Eyes dogs and the training of them will be a new experience for me."

Kevin works Monday, Tues. Weds, Friday 8am to 5pm and an occasional half day on Saturdays.  I work at an Inn 5 minutes from home and I will be able to bring the puppy to work with me to make sure I can work with the puppy as well as socialize the puppy.  If it happens that I can not for some reason bring the dog to work, Kevin works 1 minute from home and they are willing to have the puppy there as well. Kevin also can come home for lunch for a half hour to attend to the pup.  Our children are 24 and 26 years old and live in their own homes and have careers but have grown up with Labs as pets and love dogs.  Our children have threatened to move back home to help raise the puppy!  Our son lives in Portland so when we visit we can give the pup the experience of that city and our daughter lives in Boston so when the puppy is ready that is possible as well.  We live 4 miles from the center of town but it feels rural.  We do not have a fence but own 2 acres with plenty of space.  The street we live on has only 4 other homes on it so the street is quiet, great for beginning training for a puppy.  We do have an 11 year old female Lab, Tabby, who is gentle and sweet and has helped raise our children so assisting raising a puppy will be much easier! We also adopted  a cat a year and half ago, Charlie, he is 7 years old, orange, very independent and he is declawed.  He is very sure of himself and loves Tabby. We had two cats that were 20 years old and 15 years old that we lost about 1 and 1/2 years ago, we missed having them and so did Tabby.  Tabby and Charlie love to play with each other and enjoy the yard together.  Tabby is our second dog ( Black Lab) and we love dogs!  Our family mostly lives in Maine and we own a family camp about 3 hours north of us on a small lake.  It is lovely and a great place for dogs!  We are excited about being Raisers and learning the new way to train.  We have trained 2 Labs and feel we would be excellent ""Raisers""."

When I turned 65, my thoughts turned to what my legacy might be when I leave this earth. I already was familiar with GEB through my new daughter-in-law, but when I read an article in the AARP magazine, I immediately knew this was the way to go. I'm thrilled to be a small part of helping to improve the quality of life for someone less fortunate than I. Our day is usually done as we decide it to be. We're kind of big home improvement type folks, and we currently are finishing up a kitchen remodel - in time for our little foster's arrival !! Flexibility is a blessing for us at this point, and all of the required responsibilities can easily be met, and hopefully exceeded. We live in our own home, on a lot about 3/4 of an acre. Exercise space will definitely not be an issue !! We're both very active, and plan on staying that way. That said, had we purchased a pup, I probably would have chosen the more laid back of the litter. That said yet again, I'm confident we can work well with whatever pup we're assigned. The entire family is excited about the whole thing, and understand what the pup is all about, and the mission we are on to hopefully prepare him for the next step. I had the opportunity to work with one of these special creatures at puppy class this past week -  his name was Kennedy - and my enthusiasm is greater now than when I first applied. Thanks for the giving me the chance; I'll give it my all !!!!!"

329,Primary,27062,0,Eastern MA,3M314,Mario,19568,09/26/14,"As of right now I am not working regularly.  Typically our weekdays start around 6:30 with getting our 13 and 15 year old boys up for school.  They are driven to school, which is approx a 20 minute round trip.  I then usually spend the morning working around the house, running errands or walking for exercise.  I occasionally work an hour or 2 for a friend who runs a convenience store 2 doors away doing paperwork or working the counter.  I would be able to take the puppy to the store as needed.  Our 15 year old is picked up at 2:05 and the 13 year old gets off the bus at 2:35 pm.  Afternoons consist of being home with the boys.  They play outside or inside, do their homework and generally hang out and relax.  The 15 year old has activities most nights, so I leave to take him around 4:30 most evenings and then pick him up around 7:30 pm.  Generally our 13 year old is home during those times.  Although my husband recently lost his job, he is actively looking for work, so is not typically home during the weekdays.  Weekends are generally spent around home with some soccer games and swim practices mixed in.  We also have an 18 year old daughter who is a freshman in college in Pennsylvania who would be home on typical college breaks."

We love gardening, cooking, entertaining, reading, taking walks, and are involved in community events. We have 2 acres of land and lovely paved roads perfect for dog walking. I am a freelance yoga instructor, and occasionally teach photography ( former professional photographer). I enjoy and am fulfilled by the process of teaching and learning.  My schedule is flexible and allows me to be home often without being away for more than 3 hours at a time.  My husband works full-time during the week--we are both home on weekends. We usually take a two week vacation in the fall, and a short getaway in the winter.  We are calm, patient, and consistent.  We have been wanting to become puppy raisers for a couple of years now, and have researched different organizations. Guiding Eyes is the most  concise, supportive organization we have come across.

I enjoy spending my time doing constructive and meaningful things for others.  For the past year, I have volunteered 4 hours per week at Cleveland Clinic South Pointe Hospital as a greeter, wayfinder and wheel chair assistant. I work every Monday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  At the present time, I have no other commitments.  The volunteer work is flexible and I can work 3 hours instead of 4 until the puppy can be left alone for a longer period of time.  Eventually, if it is acceptable to GEB, I would like the puppy to get therapy dog certification and be able to take the dog to the hospital with me when I volunteer.    My typical day begins at around 9 a.m.  I take out and feed my dog and then make my breakfast and read email and current events until about 1:30.  I eat lunch and take my dog for a walk, and exercise in my basement in the afternoon.  I cook and eat supper between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.  I go to the grocery store at least twice a week and usually go out to dinner with friends about once or twice a week.    Because my daughters live out of town, I try to travel to see them once a month, weather permitting. I travel by car to Cincinnati and either drive or fly to Washington, DC.  My daughter in Cincinnati has a husband and 2 children, ages 1 and 3.  Even though I live alone, my GEB puppy will be exposed to my young grandchildren and my 13 year old dog.  My daughter in DC also has a 10 year old dog who used to live with me and my dog before she moved to DC.  My daughter in Cincinnati lives in a semi rural area. And my other daughter lives in Silver Spring, MD and works in downtown DC.  We use the subway system when I am visiting her.    Since I spend much of my time alone, I am looking for other ways to help people and get out of the house.  A GEB puppy will give me reasons to go places and expose the puppy to new things.  I also look forward to being an ambassador for your organization and going to events in the area."

When the puppy arrives I will be able to devote most of my day to his/her needs.  We are in a residential neighborhood, half of the households on the block have young children and dogs, our yard is fenced on three sides.  My husband travels a fair amount for work and I join him on some of the trips but we have deferred any new trips until after the puppy is six months old.  But as a result weekends are usually low key involving exercise, yard work and dinners with friends.  We have two sons, one who is a sophmore in college and who will not be home much except for Thanksgiving and Christmas and a second who is a senior in high school.  In the spring during sports season, our schedule changes and afternoons and evenings are busier with practice and games.  By that time the puppy will be six months old and able to be alone for longer periods, though I don't think I should ever need to leave him/her for more than 2-3 hours at a time."

I go to college at Northern Virginia Community College where i am getting a degree in Diagnostic Medical Sonography.   If i have an early morning class i make sure to wake up extra early and have everything ready to go.   Usually I will grab a coffee or something to eat at the school's cafe.  My classes may run either one and a half hours to three hours in duration on a weekly schedule once a week or twice a week.  My husband and I currently share our car, so after class i usually take a bus home or get  a ride home. When I finally get home it is time for lunch. Generally my husband will have just arrived home from working at Mt Vernon Animal Hospital. After grabbing a bite to eat for lunch we will be working on some homework from our classes.

Wednesdays I work at the Clarendon Grill as a hostess from 5 to 10 pm. Both of my jobs are extremely flexible with my hours and days I work. Whenever I am at work my husband is always at home since he works in the mornings only. Once I get home from work I relax for a while, watch a little television, or work on some homework. I am a night owl so I generally don't go to bed until late at night, unless I've had a long day at work.     For the passed two months now on Thursday or Friday night I babysit my neighbors children. Their eldest child gets out of preschool around 3:15 pm which is around the time I arrive at their home. I then stay there until around 6 pm when their mother comes home from work. There are some times where I may stay anywhere to an hour late depending if their mother runs into heavy traffic on her way home. My duties and responsibilities for taking care of the children is to play with them, give them their dinner, and with the weather permitting taking them out for either a long walk or to the local playground.      When it comes to the weekends I usually stay at home with my husband, make plans to go into DC, or go somewhere nearby. On Saturday afternoon I go with my husband to work at the Animal hospital. There we clean the pets that are boarding at the facility. Take each one outside for a walk ,depending on their conditions.   Give any medication that is needed to the pets. Feed the animals, some with special food.   Saturday evenings or Sunday evenings is usually family dinner night. Its a time to regroup and catch up with   all the family members that live with in the area. This is usually done at my mothers house or aunts house in Arlington."

In May through summer months we travel/are away from home a great deal, so as we get started on puppy raising we felt we could only commit to being a ""Starter Puppy Raiser"", October until sometime in April. We live in a house with a fenced back yard (6 foot wood fence), so that provide a safe play area.  We have a very mellow 8 year old yellow lab named Lillie. She gets along very well with other dogs. We anticipate being able to spend a solid amount of time daily with the pup for all the various activities. Having said that, we are overdue on doing some misc stuff on our house such as wall paper removal and painting, etc. So we will probably allocate some 2 hour blocks of time in a daily basis where the pup will be in the crate while I and my husband, Bruce do some painting/home do it yourself work. Both of us are fairly physically fit. However, I have some lower back issues where I cannot lift more than 20 pounds. (I will not be able to lift a big puppy into the car so my husband will need to do that.)     We really feel very comfortable that this an excellent fit for us, as much as being a starter puppy raiser can be. Of course we are new to the STEP training process, so are learning as we go.    Although we have 3 sons, all are grown and 2 live about 20 minutes away (may be stopping by some). They love puppies so are really interested in the upcoming puppy, but they do have busy lives of their own."

We are a busy, active family with two daughters (14 & 11), three cats and a very mellow male English Mastiff (neutered, 7 years old, 220 lbs). My husband and I work together in an office in town where we will be able to bring the puppy each day. We travel to family homes in Canada and Cape Cod fairly frequently both during the summer and the off season. Swimming will definitely be an option in each location. Because we will have the puppy in an active office, we would prefer one that is not ""too vocal"", recognizing that all puppies bark. Between my husband and I, we are able to be fairly flexible with the puppy during the work week. On the weekend, our lifestyle is busy with a lot of toing and froing to kid events. We anticipate that we will be bringing the puppy along to most events. Our daughters are very good with animals, and are looking forward to being a part of the puppy raising process."

There is ""almost"" someone home all the time. Worked out great when the kids were small and going to school and it still works now with our family pets. I love to play and tend to my gardens weather permitted but I have to play with my golden retriever first. Other then going food shopping all the time, I'm a homebody. I love to be in my cute little house swiffing fur balls from corner to corner. Many pets in this house but I love every single one of them."

Mary goes out to work 9-5 Monday - Friday. I work from home 3-4 days a week, some days going to visit customers and occasionally gone over night. Mary works 20 minutes from home so can return at lunch to care for puppy. On days at home I am free to use my time as needed, so lot's of opportunity to work with pup. My office is in the finished basement, door can be closed, puppy monitored and taught. Weekends are usually in and out, chores, errands, yard work, pool time, etc. Our home is 4 BR Colonial on 1+ acres, in a peaceful, family oriented development. Many opportunities for socialization. Yard is spacious with a large fenced in area. Our family dog is 14+, has been a big part of family life since a puppy. He is neutered. His hind quarter is arthritic, becoming very weak; he no longer sees or hears well. But his appetite is good, he is responsive and we are monitoring closely. We will not let him suffer, when the time comes we will consult with his vet and do what is necessary. We are active socially, try to get away once or twice a year for a week or so."

We are currently looking to purchase a house and it is possible we will be living in a house in Fishkill within the next few months. Mark is an engineer for the power company and works consistently M-F from the hours of 7:30-4:30 in Newburgh, NY approximately 20 minutes from home. Mark can come home for lunch on certain days, (usually 1 or 2 per week) depending on meetings and other variables. Amanda has just finished her summer job and is looking for part or full-time employment close to home.     When Mark gets home from work, we will generally do something active together such as hiking, running road biking, or going to the gym. On the weekends, we generally exercise in the morning, do some household chores, shopping, etc. Some weekends we will drive up to the Catskills to do a longer hike. We generally cook dinner every night, going out to restaurants only occasionally. Afterwords we generally watch TV.     We occasionally go away for weekend trips, and our favorite place to go is Lake Placid. When we go there, we walk around town, go skiing, hiking, biking and running, and hang out at the local restaurants, many of which are dog friendly. (Ever hear of Ubu the dog? He is a staple for the area.)      We have a cockatiel named Henry who is very friendly and likes to chirp when the sun comes up. Sometimes we allow him to walk around the condo as long as we can keep an eye on where he is. Otherwise he is generally very happy just climbing around his cage and sitting on a perch. We clip his flight feathers regularly so he doesn't try to fly and hurt himself since he is very clumsy and would otherwise fly into things. He has lived with dogs before and is not fazed by them."

We also have and a fenced-in back yard and live right near the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail which we use often for bike riding and running. We walk everywhere in town - to school, to the park, to the shops and to the train.    Kevin works in Manhattan, Malcolm, Ben & Harry all go to Farragut Middle School and I am home during the day or out running errands or exercising. In the afternoons, the kids come home to complete homework and have various activities (music, art & sports) that I drop off & pick them up from. We have family dinners at home almost every night. We have family visitors from California stay with us 4-5 times a year. The house is active & busy on the weekends with kids, neighbors & friends coming for play & family dinners. The kids play soccer on the weekends and Kevin coaches the team. We will have lots of time to walk the puppy daily and bring them to appropriate socialization activities.    Currently, we have no pets. The kids have taken care of several neighborhood cats and love it. We are all excited to raise a puppy and volunteer for Guiding Eyes. Years ago, Kevin & I lived in San Francisco and fostered a breeder, Cozy, from Guide Dogs in San Rafael. Kevin's mother and siblings are currently fostering breeders for Guide Dogs and our kids love being with the dogs when we visit San Francisco.    We enjoyed the foster experience so much we decided to volunteer with Guiding Eyes and give our children the experience of helping to raise a puppy. We attended a graduation last Spring & a puppy training class this Spring. We are ready to learn & get involved!    ~Sheree McNulty"

Breaks in work are commonplace. Everyone in the house is over 20 and has been working with the pup socialization program for many years.  I have a daughter who is away and school and visits irregularly (Christmas).      Although I arise early and generally go to bed early, my husband generally arises later and goes to be at a later time.      Walking 3 miles or more per day is not an issue.  Sidewalks are available in Yorktown, Katonah and etc.       We have a fenced in yard and plenty of experience with GEB pups."

I plan to take leave the first weeks of the puppy's arrival and then work from home.  I also live close enough to get home during the lunch break.  My plan is to bring the puppy to work once I have confidence he/she can be successful.      We live in a converted town home (used to be one town home -- now it is four separate units (terrace level, first floor, second, and third)).  We are on the third floor (walk-up).  We have only a few neighbors that make up our building.  We live in Dupont which from what I can tell is a very pet friendly neighborhood.  Folks will not be surprised or annoyed of dogs.      Weekends are low key.  We have a car and like to go see places during the weekend.  I like to be outdoors.  I am someone who is very  active when there is a purpose.  I    From what I know of at this moment, there are no upcoming life changes.      I am very excited for my first pup!!"
355,Primary,26926,0,Montgomery,10PP14,Prescott,19357,08/10/14,"I have school every weekday starting in September, but on weekends i'm usually free. I live on a farm with multiple types of animals and i have 2 dogs, both whom were drop outs at GEB. They play fairly rough and play a lot, so we won't mind an active puppy. My grandmother will be helping raise the dog, and she lives in an apartment complex on the 4th floor. A smaller dog might be better for her to handle when she has the dog over."
354,Primary,26922,0,Montgomery,6NN14,Nexus,19336,08/10/14,"There are currently eight members of our family: my husband and me, three kids (one each in college, high school, and middle school), two cats, and a snail. Our schedule during the school year goes like this--I wake up at 5:30, feed cats and lounge til 6:30 or so (this is an hour I can spend with puppy!); I leave the house around 8 for work; Jerry and kids get up around 7 and leave for school between 7:15 and 7:30; Jerry returns home from school drop off and then leaves for work around 9:45( a window of two hours or so to help with puppy) he returns for lunch at 12 or 1 for 45 min; Gracie gets home from school around 3 and Joey around 4. Jerry gets home at 4:30 and I'm usually home somewhere between 6 and 8 (but a pup might be incentive to leave earlier!). Sunday mornings our schedule is church from 8:30 til 12:30 so we may need to adjust that for the first few months or so.   We have basically no experience with dogs. I have never owned a dog and this last day with Lil has been so enlightening and enjoyable! Jerry grew up with dogs but never had one on a leash before Lil. She is so docile and friendly. I've been really impressed with how well Gracie has handled Lil. I think she's going to do a great job with a puppy.  I wrote the info for our cat vet above. I'm happy to use whatever vet you recommend.   With this being Amy's first year at college, we will need to travel to Pittsburgh a few times. We would love to bring pup but it may be better to leave with a sitter the first few times. After the trip at the end of August we don't have plans to be away other than the college trips."
382,Primary,26920,0,Central VT,9PP14,Pruitt,19356,07/25/14,"We retired October 1, 2013 from NC and moved to South Hero, VT. Our typical day is arising between 6 and 7 am and spending devotions and day planning time together.  Often we go to our local gym for approximately 1 1/2-2 hours. One day a week we a 2 hour ""Meals on Wheels"" delivery for the Grand Isles area.  1-3 days a week, Lynn drives patients to doctor's appointments.  We have several doctor's appointments approximately 6 months apart (dentist, primary practice, cardiologist, dermatologist, ophthalmologist, etc.)  We live on a 50 acre plot of land on Lake Champlain next to Lynn's brother and wife.  They have two pure-bred male labs; ages 8 years (neutered) and 5 months (to be neutered at 1 year or less).  Therefore we would request a male puppy to raise.  We have 2 adult sons and 4 grandchildren (ages 17 to 9-year-old twins).  One family lives in North Carolina and the other lives in DC; we drive to visit each 1-4 times a year.  We have plans to spend a week in Florida in March 2015.  We are actively involved in our church and our community.  Lynn also volunteers in the athletic department at UVM and coaches Little League Baseball and YMCA basketball.  We expect several visits from family and friends throughout the course of the year.  We had a female black lab for approximately 14 years and this will be our first experience with Puppy Raising for Guiding Eyes."
384,Primary,26910,0,Northern CT,1DD14,Debra,19243,07/14/14,"In terms of our schedules, our lives revolve around the academic calendar.  On a typical weekday during the school year, I teach at a middle school and our two teenagers of course go to school as well.  We leave at 7:15 AM and return around 3PM.  Sports, exercise, and perhaps a few errands happen in the afternoon.  My husband is a professor at UConn and has a very flexible schedule.  He teaches two days a week from 11 to 1:30, and then he has a night class from 6 to 9 PM one day a week.  He is home most of the time, reading, researching, writing, but also makes time to walk our seven year old yellow lab, Popcorn, to do some food shopping as needed, and to take the kids to their activities in the afternoon.  He teaches mostly from the West Hartford campus, but he goes out to Storrs periodically for meetings.     On the weekends we shuttle the kids around to friends' houses and activities, do a little shopping, a little cooking, relaxing, some entertaining, and we go to church.  Sometimes our kids have sports tournaments, but usually only one parent attends as they can be quite long (from my perspective!).    Summer plans vary, but usually include a trip.  This August we are headed to Peru from the 11th to 21st, and we are taking a quick roadtrip to D.C.  Popcorn always comes with us on roadtrips; she has traveled to Kansas, North Carolina, Maine, and even to Quebec City where she rode the funicular.  She is an indispensable part of our family and we hate to leave her behind.      We live in West Hartford, in a tranquil, wooded area that is perfect for long walks.  We have a favorite path around a lake that is about 2.5 miles.  Popcorn does this walk almost every morning with my husband, and then I take her out in the afternoon or evening for a different, shorter walk.  The kids often come along. Popcorn has had issues with her knees, so we are careful to keep her weight down and follow her cues for how far she wants to walk.  Most days she walks at least 3 miles.      The rest of us are perfectly healthy!  We are an active family in one sense, yet there is almost always someone home at our house, especially since the kids are old enough to be home by themselves.  We enjoy being home, especially just hanging out and playing with the dog.      In terms of our GEB puppy, we would definitely want a Lab.  The Labs we have owned have all come from reputable breeders of English-style dogs, and we've looked for breeders who focus on temperament in addition to looks.  We've never been interested in showing a dog, but we do appreciate a dog that conforms to breed standards.  I grew up with copies of Labrador Quarterly laying about; it's just in my blood to gravitate towards a stocky Lab with a big head.  So in the looks department we would absolutely adore a British style pup of any color except fox red.  We've always had females, but would be willing to take a male if there is a need.  As far as temperament, we can certainly handle the feistiest of young pups, but I'm not sure our own dog could handle the most energetic pup of the litter.    Thank you so much for this opportunity!  We know that volunteers don't get to pick the pups, but I thought you would want to know the biases that we bring to this project (my husband has jokingly called me a dog Nazi) so that you can make the best match for us and set us up for success.  We will, without a doubt, love whichever dog comes our way."
383,Primary,26909,0,Northern CT,10EE14,Enya,19264,07/21/14,"We live in a single family home with a fenced in back yard, on a semi-circle on a quiet neighborhood street. In our home is myself, my 11 year old son, and I have a significant other that does not live with us but is in the home on a regular basis. We have two consistent baby sitters that we use for when I have to work in the evenings (once a week typically). We have a cat that is approximately 10 years old (not sure, we rescued her from the local shelter). This cat does not seem to be affected by much, including other dogs which have come to visit for long weekends, etc. (I have never seen a cat so un-fazed by anything!) We actually just moved into this home about a month ago, but we are already unpacked and settled in.     Our summer schedule is really very flexible, my son attends camp in town for a couple of hours in the morning or in the afternoon (depends on the week), but is home at least for lunch every day. Starting in August he will have football practice every evening for a couple of hours, which is held at his school about a mil and a half away from our house. My work schedule is very flexible, I work full time for a public school system and my office is only 15 minutes away from our home, and I am able to come home during the day, and could bring the puppy with me once fully potty trained depending on my schedule for the day.    During the school year, my son has school from 8:30 to 2:50, so will be home by 3:00 in the afternoon. My work schedule gets busier, and is usually different every day, but is still flexible to allow me to come home during the day. I have a fair amount of ability to plan my own schedule for most meetings, etc. If needed, my boyfriend can also come over as well as a friend of mine that lives only a mile away and has said she would be willing to assist. I have a per diem job that I work typically one evening a week that does not allow for any flexibility but my son would be home with the puppy with our sitter during that time.    I will be away on vacation/workshop/conference one week in April and I may need a puppy sitter during that week as it is not going to be possible to bring the puppy with me. Typically my parents come down and stay with my son during this week, but they will not be familiar with the training as they live several hours away from us. We usually go away for one or  two long weekends on ski trips during the late winter, so would probably need a sitter during those as well. We were planning a cross-country camping trip for next summer but we are hoping that we could take the puppy with us for that trip.    Weekends right now we do not have any set plans, in September my son will have a football game on one day for a couple of hours. During the winter (January through March) we ski weekends and that will be all day both days. It may be possible for us to bring the dog with us, I am on the ski patrol and have some flexibility during the day, but not always and this will be when we will probably need to have someone come in during the day to take the dog out.     I can't think of anything else, but feel free to ask!!!"

Our weekends are generally free, and we expect to spend a good amount of time at my Grandmother's house at Lake Winnipesaukee (in NH) over the summer, which is a place dog's love.  Our house is in a quiet neighborhood at the south end of Cape Cod, with not much traffic, close to the beach.  We have a large yard (although not fenced, but good for running with a long line in).  We regularly play tennis at a fenced in court (and have had fun with a dog we are sitting there).

We have two, female golden retrievers that are both 11 years old (they are sisters). These dogs are very laid back although they love to run around and play with each other when they are outside. When the weather is nice they stay outside all day as we have Invisible Fence installed. We also own sheep, horses, and chickens along with two parakeets. Amy will be going to camp this summer for one week and I have agreed to train the pup during that time. Amy's sister is going to be a high school senior next fall and we will be going on several college visits this summer that may include some overnights. Amy is in the Ag program and is interested in possibly bringing the puppy to school at times.

As for weekends, I usually volunteer for Habitat for Humanity on Saturdays from about 8am-3pm. On Sundays, I have family dinners around 5:30pm with my mother and stepfather. Other than those two activities, my weekends do not have any regular structured activities.    I‚Äôm thinking a new schedule might look something like this:  6:30	  Wake Up  6:30-6:40	  Get busy/Stretch time  6:40-6:45	  Scarf down breakfast (Food bowl manners)  6:45-6:50	  Get busy #2  6:50-7:20	  Human breakfast and dress time, puppy teaching time  7:20-7:35	  Play time  7:35-7:45	  Quick walk  7:45-8:00	  Travel to Gym  8:00-9:00	  Personal Training/Workout  9:00-9:15	  Travel home  9:15-9:40	  Human getting ready time, puppy teaching time  9:40-9:45	  Get busy  10:00	  Work  2:00-2:30	  Lunch break, get busy, play time, get busy  6:00-10:30	  Get busy, play, teach, cuddle, play, teach, cuddle.

For the weekly bill-pay nights, the neighbor‚Äôs house is empty as she is with her husband in Florida as he is undergoing rehab. She has given permission for the puppy to stay with me in the house, which will be much desired company in the evenings there! None of my friends or family are allergic or otherwise opposed to dogs and therefore will be a welcomed addition for any guests I have at my apartment.    As for the weekends, as long as approved by Guiding Eyes, I believe the dog is welcome on building sites. The puppy will also be welcome to come with me to Sunday night dinners.     My best friend is a school teacher and therefore finishes her work day around 3pm and then picks up her four year old daughter, both of whom love dogs and have two of their own. I have discussed this endeavor with them and my best friend said they may be able to occasionally stop by and visit with the puppy in the late afternoons before I get home. My mother is retired and often comes to Salisbury for meetings and errands, she may also be able to stop in and show the puppy some love every once in a while. I live on the same property as the couple I rent from and the husband is starting retirement. I anticipate he will be available if any extreme emergencies arise where I am unable to get home at the necessary time.    The apartment I‚Äôm living in is a studio apartment which is just enough room for one single person. While there isn‚Äôt a tremendous amount of space in the apartment, the property I‚Äôm on is very large, safe, and quiet. It will be the perfect place to play with the puppy and allow him or her to romp around under supervision. Since I live alone, many evenings can feel lonely and I‚Äôm very excited to be able to have time and energy at this point in my life to be able to devote myself to a puppy who will grow up to become an extremely helpful friend for someone in need."

She visits for about 10 minutes and then goes home.  Usually in the afternoon, evening.    My work, Avon Dixon Insurance, has said it is ok if the puppy dog comes to work with me.  So most days the puppy dog will be with me.  It is a calm office with about 35 people in it, mostly women.  My daily life there is a lot of sitting at the desk. However, I am up a lot to the printer, the kitchen, meetings in other offices, board rooms.  I work from 7:30 to apprx 4:30.  At lunch, I sometimes go out to get food.  Sometimes I bring lunch with me.  Sometimes, I do errands at lunch.  Would the puppy dog be able to stay in his crate at work during this one hour?    My work is in the town of Easton MD ‚Äì so after work and sometimes at lunch I can walk him on the sidewalks  and near shops in town.  There is great small town exposures where I work.    My husband works as a caretaker.  The puppy dog will not be going to work with him.  However, we could take him there and introduce him to a farm.  If that is what you want us to do.  They have sheep, chickens, horses.  Hubby is also a contractor with tools‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  We can introduce loud noises with tools to the puppy dog.     I am usually home Mon ‚Äì Fri around 5:30 same for hubby.   Sometimes we do errands after work, together.  Sometimes, we go over to visit my parents.  We love to take walks after we are home from work.  We do not have sidewalks where we live.  As we live out in the country where there are only roads and grass.  We walk about 2.5 miles when we go.  You will have to let us know if the puppy dog can go with us or not since there are no sidewalks.   Although , it is great exercise for him.  We also live across from a River. I am assuming he cannot swim in it.  Our neighbor has a pool where her dogs swim, can ours swim too??    Our back yard is fenced in, therefore, he can go off lead in the yard.      On weekends, we wake about 7:00 a.m.  Weekends are really flexible.  No set schedule.  We have lots of options with what will be expected of us to do with puppy dog.  Our grandnephew (two  yrs old in July) visits my parents at least twice a month on weekends.  We can expose the puppy to him.  Just let us know if there is anything the puppy should not do while he is around children.     We do travel to Colrain Massachusetts at least once a quarter. Hubby‚Äôs dad is there as well as his sister‚Äôs family.  We usually drive.  They also live in the country with no sidewalks.  They are close to a town where we can walk him.  Then at least once a year we fly to Cape Coral Florida to visit my brother‚Äôs family.  We may be able to take the puppy dog at least once during his stay with us.    Hubby and I are pretty much laid back about life.  Not high strung. We do not have arguments between us.  Our house is calm and serene.  This is how we like to keep our life.  Our house is definitely our serene home."

We live on approx. 2 fenced acres of ground, and are extremely careful with secured gates, many call it a fortress.  Our life  is low-keyed and has always  revolved around our dog family and their schedules.    Normally if one of us is absent from the house, the other cares for the dogs and most of the time, we are close in our area.  The length of time away from home is very important to us especially  now since our senior girl needs more frequent trips outdoors.  On  occasions our best friend dog sits.

423,Primary,26669,0,Montgomery,6P14,Phoebe,19106,04/16/14,"Background:  Edward Ruitberg and Laura Ruitberg are empty nesters living in a home located in Davidsonville, MD.  Edward is the prospective primary puppy raiser and Laura is the secondary raiser.    Ed is going through a life change and raising a puppy is part of the plan.  Ed is transitioning into retirement following a 40-plus year career working for the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.  It‚Äôs been difficult to decide when to retire, but the commitment of being a puppy raiser is making it easier.  Once the puppy arrives, Ed will continue with some consulting work from home, but the puppy becomes priority number one!    Laura is retired and was a bookkeeper and office manager for various companies over her career.    Our son lives and works in Ashburn, VA, approximately 1.5-hour drive away.  He has two children that live in Oklahoma City and they come to visit us about twice a year.    We do not currently own a dog, but have three cats.  We both love dogs, but our daily work schedules and Ed‚Äôs frequent business travel didn‚Äôt lend itself to proper dog raising.     Typical Day:  We both expect to be home most every day.  We typically get up early and go to bed early.  It normally starts about 5:00 am, workdays and weekends, and ends by 10:00 pm.  Ed usually makes most of the meals.   Ed plans to do consulting work at home during the morning hours.      Lifestyle:  Ed and Laura have a quiet relaxed lifestyle, that is, until the grandchildren visit.  We are both non-smokers.  Ed‚Äôs hobbies include bicycle riding and he spends lots of time working in the yard and on other home projects.  Laura‚Äôs hobbies include reading, especially mystery novels, and quilting.  Although she‚Äôs a cat person, Laura hasn‚Äôt met a dog she didn‚Äôt like.  She always enjoys greeting and playing with the Weimaraner who lives next door.    Work schedule:  Ed‚Äôs work plan following retirement will consist of consulting work from home averaging about 12 hours per week, with occasional visits to business offices.  The schedule is totally flexible.    Weekend schedule:  Ed and Laura‚Äôs weekend schedule is open format.  There are weekend shopping trips usually on Saturday mornings.  We attend church on a weekly basis.    Home setting:  Our home is in a residential community near Annapolis, MD.  The homes are on large lots (~2 acres) so there is plenty of open space.  There are many children in the neighborhood, the elementary school is nearby, and the school bus stop is down the street.   Most of our neighbors have dogs and there are many dog-walkers.  Our neighbors have offered encouragement and support for us becoming a puppy raiser.    What led us to Guiding Eyes for the Blind:  After not having had a dog for many years, the desire for a dog came to me (Ed) in a surprising way.  Several years ago on a bicycle ride in southern Maryland I came across this dog that I still think about.  At the time, I was alone on a rural road within sight of the Chesapeake Bay.  After making a turn at this scenic place, there was this chocolate Labrador Retriever standing behind a fence silently watching me.  I came to within a few feet of the dog, made eye contact, and connected with him/her instantly.  I thought what a beautiful animal!  I continued riding, a changed person.    Recently, several people brought service dogs in training to the office.  One of these people happened to be a dog-sitter for Guiding Eyes for the Blind, Montgomery Region, and I felt that connection again with her black Labrador Retriever.  I told myself, ‚ÄúI need to get one of these dogs.‚Äù  So here I am."
421,Primary,26667,0,Catoctin,8R14,Rhiana,19116,04/18/14,"I work in the main office for a private PK-8th grade school with about 325 students. In the main office area, I sit with a co-worker, Grace, who also has dogs and is willing to help me with the puppy when I have meetings or am involved with another student.  I have about 1-3 meetings each week lasting an hour.  Our school does not have a nurse, so Grace and I handle student illness, cuts, scrapes, etc. as well.  In the past, I have provided first aid, CPR and AED training.  Grace handles the cuts, scrapes, etc.  I tend to handle the big stuff such as administering an Epi-pen.  We also have a diabetic student which I help administer or test approx. once a day which takes about 5-10 minutes. The main part of my job is development work and is very flexible.  I have permission from our headmaster, Randy Hollister, to bring the puppy with me to work each day.  In our office there are 7-8 people who have additionally said they would be willing to help with the puppy.  I tend to work from 8:15-5pm.  I typically work the last two weeks of August until the third week of June and a couple of days in July.  The summer hours are 9am-3pm.  The puppy/crate would be by my desk, but out of the way.  I do not work in a classroom or have any set times that I am watching students.  However, I plan to take full advantage of having all these people around for the puppy to meet!    Our family lives in a rural area. We have about 30 acres which is mainly wooded.  We have 2 labs; Blackie has had 5 litters and we kept one from the first litter, Vader.  Both are females and not neutered.  Blackie is 12 years old and Vader is 9 years old.  Both have outside kennels and until this past cold winter, stayed outside all year around.  Blackie is slowing down and so we kept them in the kitchen area most of the winter.  We have an open floor plan but taught them to stay in the kitchen area.  With the warm weather, they are back outside all the time now.  However, the puppy would be with us wherever we are in the house.  We also have two cats, our mousers, Santa and Mrs. Claus.  They are also mostly outside except on cold winter nights.  Mrs. Claus and Vader are often seen licking each other!  Our cats are used to puppies and our dogs are as well.  We have not fenced in our yard, but have kennels and an extra kennel we used when we were raising Blackie's puppies.  When outside and not on a leash, we would use this extra kennel.  We are working to fence in our yard because of all of the deer in our area, but have only started that project.     My husband often works from home and will keep the puppy home when I can't bring the puppy to work. He has raised several dogs and is very interested to learn how it's done with Guiding Eyes.  Alex is a sophomore at Virginia Tech and will be home for the summer in May.  His plans aren't set yet, so we're not sure how much he'll be home for helping with the training.  Leland is a junior in high school and leads the NJROTC drill team.  They practice each day from 4-5pm. He also takes guitar lessons.  Leland is really looking forward to help raising the puppy.  Besides me, he will be doing a lot of the training.  He hasn't been able to take the classes because of his school exams, but I've been going over the material with him.    I work out 4-6 times a week, twice a week with a trainer.  He said I could bring the puppy there.  We do not generally go running, but if we do, I'd make other arrangements for the puppy.  The other workout times are at home in the morning or evening for 30-45 minutes.      I also volunteer for our church. We are considering expanding our facilities and I am on the finance portion of the building committee.  We meet after church on Sundays twice a month for about an hour and half.  I also help out with the youth group who meet Sunday evenings for a couple of hours.  We have often taken Blackie's puppies to them and to school for socialization, so they are used to this from our family!    On the weekends, I'm either running errands, playing in the garden, going to concerts (we are music fans!), or getting together with friends.    Most of my schedule and my family's schedule is flexible.  I don't see us having blocks of time when the puppy will be crated and alone.  If I had something going on at school, my husband would either work from home or take the puppy with him to his work.  He has a separate closed door office and a co-worker has one of our pups from Blackie.  My main concern for the puppy is being able to take the puppy to work with me each day in an open office area and being around PK-8th grade children.  I think this will work.  I know I will have to expand my hours a bit to do the training and bathroom breaks.  And I have taken several batches of 1-8 week old puppies to school for a few hours, but haven't taken a single puppy to work for several months and would welcome any suggestions!    We are all looking forward to this opportunity.  Thank you so very much for considering us!"

Tues-Thurs I'm on the road.  I work in a very dog friendly environment.  We have neighbors who have offered to let the puppy out during the day and who will follow instructions we give them.  We also live across the street from another GEB puppy.      We have 3 busy and active children.  Lots of opps to bring the puppy to new environments when she's ready.      We go away a lot during the summer.  Two separate one week vacations planned.  We also have a summer camp that we spend quite a bit of time at during summer.

We also feel that our 4-year-old Golden Retriever, Aisling, will love being part of the process.      A typical work day for us starts with coffee and then a walk with our dog before work.  John works Monday-Friday, but I only work on Thursday and Fridays so am home during the day for three of the work days.  I am at work all day on Thursdays and Fridays, but since John works very close by, he is able to come home during his lunch hour to visit with Aisling (and the puppy) and get them out for a bit.     During the evenings and weekends, we also spend a lot of time with Aisling and take her lots of places with us."

She works from home and takes and picks my brother up from preschool. Other than that she is home the majority of the day. I get home at 3 pm and normally eat dinner and do homework for two to three hours. I participate in a camp counselor meeting from 7-9 pm every Monday. School will let out on May 30th so at that point I will be home all day with the puppy. We live on a caul-de-sac and have protected yard.

428,Primary,26660,0,Dominion,6F14,Figgie,18966,04/04/14,"My work schedule changed on September 1, 2013, when I transitioned out of my full-time role as office manager of the Tysons office of a national CPA firm (I call this my pre-retirement role).  My new role as the regional efile administrator is part-time, very seasonal in nature and allows me to do 95% of my work remotely from home.  My heaviest work cycles are from February 15th through April 15th and from September 1st through October 15.  The rest of the year I work varying hours.  I would consider my schedule to be extremely flexible.    My daily schedule right now during ‚Äúbusy season‚Äù consists of working for several hours on the computer in the morning then treadmill or the gym for an hour then back to work.  I try not to work more than 2 hours without taking at least a 20 minute break.  Appointments and errands are usually worked in during the afternoons.  Current daily working hours are about 10 to 12 hours per day.  I work in the office one day a week and typically that day is only about 3 to 5 hours.  Evenings are usually pretty quiet and spent on wind down activities like cooking and reading.    I work most weekends during busy season but make time for major household chores and DIY projects around the house.  I enjoy gardening and in the good weather months I like walking in area parks and at the nearby lake.  I also enjoy playing tourist and visiting the various exhibits and museums in DC.    This will be my first summer on my new schedule and I feel like I will have virtually tons of free time.  There will be weeks that I only work 1 to 2 hours a day and some weeks when I do not work at all.  I look forward to exploring several volunteer opportunities after April 15th.  I am applying to become a CASA volunteer (Court Appointed Special Advocate for abused or neglected children) in Fairfax County.  This will involve occasional court appearances and regular visits to clients and health care professionals (typically only 1 to 2 hours per week).  I also hope to sign up for Meals on Wheels and for projects with Habitat for Humanity.  And last, but not least, I would welcome the opportunity to become a puppy raiser/sitter for Guiding Eyes for the Blind."
408,Primary,26653,0,Ohio,7T14,Thunder,19134,05/09/14,"In the summer when I first get my puppy, I like to get up semi early and get exercise. But at the same time I love to relax and sit back and take the time to think about my day. After I get up, like I said, I like to workout. Then I may read a book outside and eat lunch. I spend most of my days in the summer outside and with other people too. I do  not live on a main road, I live in a neighborhood that has a long street that is perfect for running, and I live right next to a beautiful park, that unfortunately, but to my benefit, no one uses. When school comes around I wake up at six fifteen and get ready for school, but I am totally willing to get up earlier to take my puppy out to get busy and go for a walk. When I am at school my mom will be letting the puppy out and feeding it it's lunch. When I get home I will play with the puppy more and take It out and for a walk. When basketball season starts, although I am not sure that I am going to be doing basketball, I am usually home at seven at night, but I wake up and would do the same routine with the puppy in the morning, my mom is home most of the day will take care of it when I am at basketball too. I have an older dog who has bad joints so if there is a puppy who does not jump excessively that would be wonderful for my 11 year old golden retriever. I know my family and I were thinking of a German shepherd but I am really into the thought of getting a lab."
430,Primary,26622,0,Eastern MA,6V14,Vern,19150,04/01/14,"My husband and I live on Cape Cod and have three children and one dog.  I have been a stay at home Mom for the past 23 years.  My husband owns a business with his partner and they repair european automobiles.  They have done well and grown over the past 19 years.  Our three children are in college.  The two oldest will graduate in May and our youngest will be a sophomore this fall. Three years ago my Mom relocated to the Cape from Pennsylvania.  She was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer eight years ago.  She started needing a little help and wanted to be closer to me.  You never would have known she had cancer, she managed to live without the horrible consequences cancer can sometimes bring.  However, this past September she passed away.  Her batteries simply ran out.  She did however live out her life with her positive spirit, happy personality, dignity and simply never gave into her illness.   The last four months of her life she stayed in our home, again you never would have know she had anything wrong, she was a pleasure to have around.  She loved the company of the children, my husband, me and our dog.  So, I have gone from being a mom, attending countless swim meets for 17 years and then being responsible for my Mom's well being to having time I never had before.  My mothering will never end, however the day to day responsibilities are now different.  I have countless projects that are finally getting done and although I am busy I have time I haven't had before.    Being able to give my mother the comfort of being at home during the end of her life gives me great peace.  All she wanted was to be at home with family, I am thankful we were able to do that.  She loved her independence and ability to keep it as long as she could.  I think of the blind person wanting the same thing.  I would like nothing more than to help in a dogs journey to becoming that independence for someone.      Let me briefly tell you about our dog Ollie.  He is a well exercised (I try and walk 5-6 miles each day), 8 year old, 100 pound English lab.  He is nothing less than part of our family.  He has a dog bed in every room that the family may gather.  His job in life has been loving his family.  If he is leaning on your foot he is content.  Everyone in the family is responsible for Ollie's well being. We bring Ollie wherever and wherever we can.  We are what I call very responsible dog owners.      I do believe at this time in my life I have the opportunity to give something back.  My time is free and my discipline and dedication is unmeasured.  I am a goal setter, I have run many a marathon with two goals, do better than the last time and finish.  My goal with a pup of course would have one goal, graduate to helping a blind person.        I don't know what I can say to help with the match of a pup in our home.  I believe Ollie will be welcoming as he is with meeting most dogs but perhaps a male is better than a female just to keep the peace.  We are here to help and hope you will consider us for pup placement.     Carol Cavanaugh"

Until pup is old enough to be alone for 5 hours or so, I'd either do a short shift or take them with me & crate them in a spare office while I give tours.    Wednesdays I am at my parish & pup can come with me.  (Charlotte always did).    Thursdays I'm a docent at a different museum so the same deal as Tuesdays.    Fridays are errand & laundry day.  Not hard to work out my schedule to accomodate puppy.    Weekends are pretty quiet.  Dinner with friends (who are already asking when the puppy can come), my husband is a competitive shooter so he is at the range a lot.  Sundays start with early church (have already been told that pup is welcome to come) & then reading or needlepoint on our front porch.  (God we sound boring).    Do have some issues with this specific April - which is when I understand the next batch of puppies will be up.  Holy Week Apr 13-Apr 20, is really really busy time for me at church.  And then we are going to the beach for a week starting the 9th of May and wouldn't be alble to take puppy since we are already committed to a non-dog condo.  End of May would be perfect.  If thats not possible, I'd be perfectly happy to puppy sit until the next batch comes along.    And on a really shallow note, , if I could pick the puppy it would be a black one since my Charlotte was black & all my carpets etc were chosen to hide black dog hair.  But yellow is fine as would be a German Shephard.  (Grew up with them.)"
432,Primary,26601,0,Dominion,7I14,Ingrid,19000,03/28/14,"Betker Family Life    Weekday Timetable: (FYI. James, Rosie and Mairead are all Homeschooled)    5:30 a.m. Dellie (the Papillion) wakes Bob (Dad Betker) to go out to go potty.  6:00 a.m. Bob gets up for work  7:15 a.m. Bob leaves for work  7:30-ish Colleen (Mom Betker) gets up. Let's dogs Dellie and Jessie (the pound hound) outside again. Mostly to check for squirrels.  8:00-ish James, Rosie and Mairead are woken up.  8:30-ish Kids come down and start getting breakfast.  9:00-ish Kids should be heading upstairs to shower and change.  9:30-ish Kids should be heading down to start schoolwork.  10:00-ish Kids are finally downstairs and starting on schoolwork.  11:30-ish Kids take a break and if they haven't already they will often take the dogs for a quick walk.  12:00 to 4:00 Kids work on schoolwork and take small breaks as necessary and get lunch when hungry.  4:00 p.m. Kids can use electronics for leisure  6:00-ish Bob gets home from work and family dinner is served. After family dinner dogs are fed.  Somewhere between end of dinner and 8:00p.m. Family gets together for prayers.  9:00 p.m. Mairead and Rosie get ready for bed.  10:00 p.m. Girls finally settled down and go to sleep.   10:00 p.m. James gets first call for bed, which means he goes downstairs for a snack  10:00-ish Colleen goes to sleep  11:00 p.m. James get lights out call (if still awake.) Bob let's dogs out for final time and comes up for bed.  11:30 Bob goes to sleep    Jessie and Dellie are let out periodically throughout the day on an as needed basis. (They let us know when they want/need to go out.) Mostly they go out to check the yard for invading squirrels or such.  Dogs sleep most of the day just waking periodically to check out what is going on in the house.    ‚Ä¢	Jessie is our calm, happy, laid back 45 lb. All American Dog.  We got her from the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, when she was about a year.  She is now about 11 years old, but does not show any significant signs of aging.  She loves attention and is a real Daddies girl. (When Bob went to Iraq poor Jessie became very sad and melancholy, pining for her Dad. Thankfully she recovered once he returned. She loves to follow him all over the house as he does his chores on the weekends.) During the school day Jessie usually sleeps upstairs on whatever kid blankets have been left on the floor, or sometimes in the open kennel in the kitchen. Jessie mostly likes to snuggle on the floor with James at night. (Yes, James sleeps on the floor.  I think he does it now, just to get around the rule of, ""No dogs on the beds."") Even though she loves to be with James, she does make her rounds to each bedroom at some point during the night.  Jessie is what most people would die for in family dog.  She loves having her head and neck scratched, and when happy (which is most of the time) her tail wags a million miles a minute.  She also loves carrying the kid‚Äôs stuffed animals around the house.  She never chews on them or destroys them, just sweetly carries them around.  She also rarely barks.  In fact, she didn‚Äôt bark at all for the first few years, but now occasionally barks at critters in the yard.  She has also been know to hide behind trees waiting for the squirrels to come down so she can chase them off again.    ‚Ä¢	Dellie, our hefty 13 lb. Papillion, on the other hand is feistier. She affectionately goes by the nickname, fuzz-ball and suffers from the typical small dog mentality; I'm really a Great Dane in disguise. Dellie generally stays downstairs during the school day with Mom and kids or goes to her post on the stairs where she can monitor anyone passing in front of the house while still keeping an eye on the family. (Dellie has delusions of grandeur and fancies herself the great family protector.) Dellie tends to bark a little, mostly when she sees someone walking their dog down the street or when someone comes to the door.  Dellie, although not hyper, is more active than Jessie, especially in the yard.  Rosie is Dellie's favorite person. They bonded early when Dellie figured out that Rosie typically left a trail of food wherever she goes.  Dellie, although not aggressive, does not warm up to other dogs instantaneously. Even though we have had a number of ‚Äúfoster‚Äù dogs through our house in the past few years, it still takes her a few days for her to get used to the idea of a new invader.  Once she is satisfied that the new dog knows she is top dog in the house she settles down.    Scheduled Activities:    ‚Ä¢	Monday, Tuesday and Thursday we try (emphasis on try) to reserve exclusively for schoolwork. (But would also be flexible during this time to incorporate puppy needs.)  o	James has Boy Scouts on Monday evenings from 7:00 to 8:15.  (To accommodate this, one of the kids and Colleen will drive Bob to work in the morning. We will leave about 7:15 and be back around 8:30 a.m. Then at 4:30 one of the kids and Colleen will go back and pick up Bob from work so Bob has time to have dinner before taking James to Boy Scouts.)  o	Rosie and Mairead will take a Pottery class though Fairfax County Recreation from 2:30 to 4:00 on Mondays, from March 31 through June 2, 2014. James will stay home. (Might be an opportunity here for socializing.)    ‚Ä¢	Wednesdays are our activities day and go generally as follows:  o	9:20 - Rosie, Mairead and Colleen leave for horseback riding lessons. James stays home to work on schoolwork.  o	11:20 - We swing by the house to pick up James and karate gear and head off for karate lessons.  o	2:00-ish - We swing by the house to drop off the girls and James and I head over to Fort Belvoir for his teen group meeting.  o	4:20 - James and I leave Fort Belvoir to go home.   o	(However, once or twice a month on Wednesday Bob and I go out for ""Life Counseling."" On those Wednesday's, once James and I leave Fort Belvoir, we will head to downtown D.C. to go pick up Bob from work. If it is one of the weeks to pick up Bob, we will then head home to drop-off James and then Bob and I go out. Kids fend for themselves for dinner, James takes care of the dogs and Bob and I return around 8:30.).    ‚Ä¢	On Friday's the kids and Mom attend an educational co-op with other homeschoolers at Good Shepherd Church in Mount Vernon.  We leave the house around 8:30 a.m. and return around 1:00 p.m. The spring program ends May 2, 2014 and doesn‚Äôt resume until fall 2014.    ‚Ä¢	Weekends are unpredictable. We do not currently have any regularly scheduled activities. So, on weekends we try to get the house cleaned up (or relatively so) and do any running around and errands that need to be done. Anything that will help reduce the strain on the weekdays. Dellie still wakes Bob up around 5:30 to go potty and check the yard, Mom still gets up around 7:00-7:30, but Bob and kids grab a few extra winks and tend to get up on their own somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00, 10:00 at the very latest. Bedtime tend to remain the same as weekdays.    ‚Ä¢	Summer is also unpredictable.  In the past we have done swim team or other activities or camps during the summer, along with a quick excursion to the beach at some point.  In the past, we have also typically taken a family vacation to Vermont the third week in July.  This summer the only thing on the schedule thus far is Boy Scout Camp for James the second week in July. Kids seem to prefer the unstructured, low-key summer to those of the past.  (Bob‚Äôs father died over the winter and Bob used a good bit of his leave.  So we currently are unsure if we will be able to take a family vacation this summer.)    In the past I would have described our house as loud and active, but somewhere in the past year or so as the kids have gotten more into their electronics and started to headed towards their teens, both the activity level and noise level have dropped significantly.  So although Bob and I often feel like we are being pulled in several directions, overall house has slowed down.     Lastly, we have one daughter away at college.  She is 23 years old and is finishing her Bachelors in Sign Language Interpretation at Towson University in Maryland.  She has her own apartment and works full-time in addition to going to school.  Because of her busy schedule she doesn‚Äôt get to stop by the house as often as she would like.  Her visits tend to be two or three quick stops by the house during the week and then no visits for two or three weeks.  She is expected to graduate from Towson in the Spring of 2015 but will probably not return to the house to live after graduation.    Sorry about the length, being brief has never been my strong suit.  And you said, ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúleave a novel.‚Äù"
440,Primary,26558,0,Catoctin,8I14,Irby,19001,03/11/14,"I work from home.  I go to bed early and wake up early.  Usually my morning begins with taking my dog out, making coffee, breakfast, and reading.  After an hour or two, I wake up the kids for school, help with homework, talk while they eat breakfast, and figure out the schedule for the day.  At 8 the kids go to the bus.  I come home and start work.  I typically work from 8-4 and I know I will need to add breaks for the puppy.  The kids get home at 4.  My son usually goes outside to play and my daughter hangs out inside.  My husband comes home around 7. The whole family is typically in bed by 9.  About once a week, I go out to lunch.  Once a month, I travel to Philadelphia for a day of work.  We live in a 3 story townhome.  Our bedrooms are on the third floor."
464,Primary,26556,0,Catoctin,2H14,Hali,18985,02/27/14,"We are a family of 4 with 2 pugs (male and female that have been spayed and neutered).  I am a stay at home mom to two sweet girls.  Mia Nicole will be 7 yrs old in May and is currently in 1st grade.  She is my laid back, extremely kind, and sensitive child.  Ava Victoria will be 4 yrs old in May and is currently in 3 day preschool.  She is my funny, active, and out going child!  My husband has a full time job with some travel.  He is usually out of the house from 8am till 7pm most days and home weekends.  I will be the primary raiser for the puppy, but my family will help when they are home.  The family as a whole will understand all GEB trainings and concepts, so the pup on program will receive consistent and clear instruction and care.  We are an animal friendly and loving family!  We currently have 2 pugs that are very friendly and get along well with other animals.  Bailey is my fawn female and she will be turning 11 years old in September.  Taylor is my black male and he will be turning 9 in June.  They are very social and enjoy the company of other animals.  One of their favorite doggy friends is a 90 lbs lab mix named Bella.          Our typical day varies with school and activities for the girls.  During the school year, we are up and out of the house by 8:30am.  Our pugs still prefer their crate when we are not home.  Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I drive Mia to school and then drop Ava off at her preschool by 9am.  I am free from 9am to 11:30am or till 12:30am if Ava does lunch bunch.  During that time, I usually go to the gym.  When I have my GEB puppy, I plan to use that time as one-on-one training with the puppy.  In September '14, Ava will start her 4's preschool and will be going 5 days a week.  In August '15, both girls will be in elementary school full time Monday-Friday 8:30am till 3:30pm.  So, I will have even more ""free time"".  Right now, I pick Ava up from preschool at 11:30a and we go home for lunch.  We are home from noon till 3:15p most days, except for Fridays.  On Fridays, we usually get home around 2pm, bc Ava has Little Gym after preschool.  Every day Mia is in school, we leave the house around 3:15p.  If the weather is nice, we walk to school to pick up Mia.  We only live 2 blocks from Mia's school.  On Mondays, we leave around 5pm for Mia's dance class.  We return home around 7pm and my husband is usually home to greet us.  On Tuesdays, we are home all evening.  Right now, the only thing we have on Tuesdays is dropping and picking Mia up from school.  It's usually my day to do most of my laundry and bathroom cleaning.  I vacuum everyday.  I only use natural cleaning products, so no harmful chemicals around the kids or the dogs.  When cleaning my hardwood floors, I only use a steam cleaner...again, no harmful chemicals to harm the kids or dogs.  On Wednesdays, we have the same morning routine, but after picking Mia up at 3:15p, we are home for the rest of the evening and night.  On Thursdays, we drop Mia off at school and are home all day till we pick Mia up after school.  Then we go to Mia's gymnastics class from 4:30p till 6pm, then home for the night.  On Fridays, I drop both girls off at school, pick Ava up around 11:30p, lunch, Little Gym, and home by 2pm.  We pick Mia up from school and home by 4pm.  I am the classroom mom for Mia's 1st grade class and plan to continue that in the future, so I do assist and volunteer at her school from time to time.  Mia is also in girl scouts and I am the cookie mom for her troop.        Our schedule at a glance for the school year:  Mondays:  8:30a-9:00a:  Drop off both girls at school                   11:30a:  pick Ava up from preschool                    12:00p:  Lunch, errands, cleaning (usually at home for lunch)                    3:15p:  Pick Mia up from school (unless she has girl scouts (once a month),                                                      then I would pick her up at 5pm from school).                    5:00p-7:00p:  Mia's dance                    7:00p:  home for the night *girl's bedtime is 8:00pm during the week on school nights  ***except for during soccer season...she has gymnastics from 6:30p to 8:00p.

I will use this day for doctor and                                               dentist appointments as needed.                       3:15p:  Pick up Mia from school                     4:30p-6:00p:  Mia's gymnastics (during soccer season, Mia's gymnastics is on                                            Mondays).                         6:30p:  Home for the night and we start dinner and bedtime            ***Except for soccer spring and fall soccer season:  5:30p-6:30p:  Mia's soccer practice    Friday:  8:30a-9:00a:  Drop both girls off at school               11:30a-2p:  Pick up Ava, lunch, Little Gym, and home by 2p               3:15p:  Pick up Mia               4p:  Home for the rest of the night unless we have a social event  ***Soccer season:  5p-6p:  Ava's soccer practice     Saturdays:  Usually my girls do not have set scheduled weekend activities, except for soccer season...  8:30a-9:30a:  Ava's soccer games  1:30p-2:30p:  Mia's soccer games  We usually attend Mass as a family at 5p-6p.    Sundays:  10a-11:15a:  Mia has formation classes at our church, but only during the school year.    Our summer schedule:  Mid-June to Mid-August is more flexible.      Our weekends can be very busy or very laid back.  It all depends on sports, birthday parties, and social events.  When the weather is nice, we are usually outside...either hiking, going to the park, lake, pool, backyard, camping, or some kind of adventure!  I am originally from NC and my husband is from MI.  So, we also travel on the weekends in the summer (usually via car).  We have a large cross over, so it can accommodate kids and dogs.  We have an annual family beach trip every summer (we drive).  Also during the summer (June-August), our schedule is more flexible as the kids are out of school and we will not have a set schedule.  The girl's will have their camps and activities, but they vary and are not as consistent as during the school year.  However, our family does love schedules and we are very organized.           During the spring and fall (April to June and September to beginning of November..usually 12 weeks or so) both girls are in soccer.  Mia has soccer practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays for an hour and games on Saturday usually lasing an hour as well.  Ava has practice on Friday evenings and a game on Saturday as well.  This is a very fun activity for the whole family and when appropriate, I think this will be great exposure, learning experience, and fun for the puppy as well!  We will be at the soccer field Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and twice on Saturday during soccer season.        We live in a 3 story single family home in the suburbs of Washington, DC.  We have a fenced in yard and live in a neighborhood.  Our neighbors are very close and we have many neighbors.  We also have many close friends that live in our neighborhood and most have dogs that we can use for socialization until our pups are fully vaccinated!  Most our friends also have fenced in yards.  We have ample side walks and many trails.  Since we do live in the suburbs, it is important to get more experience for our pup on program.  We have DC that is 30 miles away that will provide new experiences:  city, public transportation, metro, more people, more cars, busier streets, etc.  We also live near Baltimore and Annapolis.  Annapolis has more opportunities as well with the water, boats, bridges, etc.  It will be a fun day out with the whole family!      We participate in numerous charity events through the year.  The girls and I volunteer at the soup kitchen and participate in a special event near Thanksgiving for the homeless shelter every year.  I also run at least 2 half marathon races a year (usually for charity).  These activities usually occur on weekends or during the summer.      We feel blessed to be a part of such an amazing organization and be surrounded by such wonderful people!  We cannot wait to get started!"
471,Primary,26555,0,Catoctin,10F14,Flint,18970,02/24/14,"I am a full time student at Littlestown High School, and I am currently in tenth grade.  I participate in softball during the spring for school, and play for a tournament team during the summer.  Any time that I am not in school is considered flexible and after school practices.  However, my sister has agreed to take the puppy out to eliminate, feed the puppy, and have play time.  All the members of my family have agreed to helping to raise the puppy, but I will be the leader.  I am planning on waking up early to take care of the puppy, to go on walks before I get ready.  I understand that some mornings it may be hard, but the puppy's needs will come before mine, even if that means not doing my hair that day.  I have another dog in my house, named Buddy, which I think will be a great role model towards the puppy.  Also, I have two cats, which will give the puppy another opportunity to socialize with other animals.  However with softball and other school commitments, it may be hard for me to be on time getting to Frederick at the 6 o'clock time.  Also, depending if I would have an away game, I may not be able to make it to the 7 o'clock.  But, the season only runs through the beginning of May, so I do not see this being too big of an issue.  Also, with my mom not getting home until 5, and having traffic on the way into Frederick, it is also hard to make the 6 o'clock time.  I will try my best to be on time to all of the meetings and I feel like I would be a good puppy raiser."

I get up early to get everyone up and moving, so with a puppy, I plan on getting up even earlier to make sure I have time to take care of puppy's needs as well. After everyone is off to school or work, I usually start working. I make my own hours, so I will be able to take plenty of breaks to spend with puppy whenever I can. Once my children and my husband come home, they are all happy and willing to play with puppy and help with some of the training. We are all very excited to have this puppy in our lives. Weekends we love to get out and go hiking or do things as a family. We live in a neighborhood with sidewalks and we have a backyard where we can go out and play. There are lots of opportunities for different experiences in this area. We have a lot of plans for what kind of places to bring puppy over the next year and a half."
467,Primary,26509,0,Central CT,1A513,Abe,18876,02/26/14,"(Kristin writing!) Karim & I will probably be splitting our puppy raising responsibilities in half due to our schedules and the fact that it is just the two of us, no other family members. We live in a one-floor/one-bedroom hours (no upstairs/downstairs) in a pretty rural part of Watertown (we can't even get internet connection at the house) that is bordered by a summer camp and a horse farm.  The house has about a 1/4 mile long driveway...so there is lots of room outside!  We are both very active and do a lot of biking & running, so we are used to having to go outside in all kinds of weather.  Karim works at UConn (there will be some awesome socialization options on campus at some point!) and I work at the YMCA (about 10 minutes from home, so not far). Monday-Thursday I will typically be the one to get up in the morning with the puppy, before work, and then Karim will be home with him most days until noonish, and in the afternoon I will be home, or be able to take a break and come home for a while to let the puppy out.  We are both off on Fridays, so it is only four days during the workweek we have to juggle schedules a bit. We have a close friend who actually works on the camp property next door to the house who has said she would be willing to learn the process by which we are training the puppy, etc. (understanding that the puppy will need consistency) in case we need her to go over and check on him and take him out to get busy in a pinch. I frequently work late on Tuesdays, but we should be able to lay out our schedule and figure out which Tuesdays I can come to, which Tuesdays Karim can come to, or when we can go to another region on Saturdays if neither of us can pull off the Tuesday that week. We will be going out of the country for a wedding at the end of December and will need a puppy sitter at that time, for two weeks.  Overall we are very excited about doing this, and being a puppy raiser for a program like this has been a dream of mine since I was a child, which Karim is totally on board with and looking forward to as well."

Chelsea is waking up between 7:30 and 7:45 and has breakfast before having class or going to work at Bennett High School. Chelsea returns home most days at 12 pm for a couple of hours before having another class or waiting for Neil to get home to go to the gym together. Chelsea has a fairly flexible schedule all days of the week except when her classes come in. Neil's schedule during the week is not very flexible since he works Monday through Friday 8 am to 4:30 pm, but he is off on the weekends. However, on the days when Chelsea can not get home to be with the puppy Neil will be able to come home on his 60 min lunch break to take the puppy out and play/work with the puppy. Almost every night of the week we are home, relaxing and will be able to play and work on fundamentals with the puppy/dog. Most of our weekends involve cleaning the duplex that we live in, we don't often leave the house on the weekends except to go grocery shopping or to go see a movie. We do live in a duplex and the residents of the other side are our friends, and we have two roommates who understand the responsibility of this and are willing to help in any way that they can. But other then that it is just the two of us and we are very excited for this opportunity."

My husband owns his business which is 10 minutes away from home and is committed to coming home each work day to make sure the puppy gets out every 3 hours. He also is thinking that he would like to bring it with him to the office on a frequent basis. I am a college educator and will has a lot of time off in the summer so I will be home all day from mid June to mid August. As the puppy is better trained I believe my college will let me bring it to work with me. Our house is a raised ranch in a suburban development in a small village outside of Albany NY. We have a summer camp on a lake in the Heldeburg Mountains and plan on bringing the puppy there with us. I am committed to training each morning and afternoon with the puppy-I have gone through obedience training with all three of my dogs. We do not have any big travel or life style plans in the near future other than our hopes to raise one of the puppies!  Please feel free to call me at 518-628-8132 days or 518-765-3747 nights if you need more information. Thanks!

I do get an hour lunch break which I generally take to work out but other people take for lunch and errands outside of the office.  Currently I am in the P3 program between PepsiCo and Guiding Eyes where we can socialize GE puppies at the office.  I would have to get approval to bring in older GE pups but I feel based on the ambassadors and management‚Äôs knowledge and experience with this program that it could happen that I could bring the pup with me to work on certain days.  I am at a desk most of the time and occasionally have meetings that are not on a consistent schedule that could be moved around or taken over the phone so I feel like I‚Äôm in a position now it would allow me to have the flexibility to leave my desk to take the pup out to get busy or exercise.       On the weekends I stay within the area doing errands or hanging out with friends or boyfriend who is 10 mins away as well.  I like to spend my free time with my 5 year old dog going on walks around the block or park or taking her to the dog park if the weather is nice.      I live at home currently with my Mother and Father and we have 1 acre property but our yard is not fenced in.  My mom is retired and cannot drive for the next few years so she stays at home with our 2 dogs (5 and 15 years old) or sometimes goes to work with my Dad (maybe two times a month), so she is available to be with the pup or take him/her out and play too.  My dad works about 35 mins away and even when he is home he is on his computer working.  Sometimes my parents will take walks together but they take it easy most weekends just going to the store of working on things around the house so they stay home most weekends.    I feel overall we are all in a good position in my household to provide guidance, support, training and attention to GE pups."
481,Primary,26446,0,Maine,3A14,Ann,18887,02/12/14,"Our family's daily schedule:  Rob wakes at 4:45 am and prepares to leave for work shortly after 5 am. He gives Zoe (our elderly Dalmatian) an outdoors opportunity to relieve herself.  Colm (7 yo) wakes between 6-7 am. and Chris follows. Zoe is fed by Colm and put outside to relieve herself. We prepare breakfast and do morning chores.  7-9 am Colm enjoys some free play time and Chris does chores/reads the newspaper.  By 9 am we have begun homeschooling which will continue for the morning. We often take short breaks to play or run a quick errand.  Lunch is at noon.  The first part of the afternoon is usually our ""quiet time"" when Chris reads/writes/prepares lessons while Colm plays independently. After awhile Colm has afternoon chores to do in order to ""earn"" screen time. After that we may run a few more errands before we prepare dinner for 5 pm. After dinner Colm and Rob have time together. In better weather they often play outside, but in colder months they stay inside. Colm is in bed by 8 pm and Chris follows soon after. Rob is a night-owl and is usually up working/gaming/reading until close to midnight. Zoe is given an outside opportunity before Rob goes to bed.   Of course Chris and Colm's schedule may change due to play dates, occasional day trips, etc.  Weekends are often varied. In the warmer months we enjoy kayaking, hiking, going to the beach, and camping. In the cooler months Colm and Rob often ski.   We see a puppy fitting into our daily schedule well. Chris and Colm think that ""puppy outings"" to socialize the puppy are likely to happen during the afternoons, but we do have flexibility. We do not anticipate that the puppy will have to spend excessive amounts of time in its crate during the day.   The only major change to our life that I can anticipate for the next year or two is that (sadly) we are likely to loose our Zoe as she is currently 12 years old."
493,Primary,26432,0,Montgomery,4K413,Kayak,18804,01/15/14,"I work at home, so my work schedule is very flexible. I occasionally need to attend meetings out of the home. I have 3 children (ages 12, 13 and 15) that are with me 50%+ of the time and will be assisting with raising the puppy. We also have a male golden retriever (who will turn 10 in February, but is still very active at this point), who is very friendly with other dogs, including pups.    Probably the most important thing schedule-wise is that we have a place in Pennsylvania (near Ligonier) where we go for numerous weekends, particularly in the summer. We also usually are there for 1 or 2 full weeks. I'm hoping that there is a facility in that area (perhaps Greensburg, Latrobe or Johnstown) where we could occasionally attend class with the pup this summer. If not, we will need to schedule our trips accordingly, and may need another raiser to help once or twice."
488,Primary,26410,0,Erie,2O413,Olaf,18845,01/26/14,"I am a full time college student with a demand of school work. My typical class schedule is 4 or less classes a day which amount to 1 to 6 hours of class with varying amounts of breaks depending on the day. I live on campus in a dorm room with a roommate. Each dorm floor has about 30 rooms with 5 floors in the building. During the school week (Monday-Friday) I do not work at a secondary job, my primary job is school work.  A puppy who is more quiet is preferable. On the weekends (Saturday-Sunday) I work at a dollar store away from school which entails me to stay at my house (Orchard Park) for those days and off campus. On average I can work from 4-6 hours on those days. Though I will be away from the puppy for those times, my mother, who has been taking the pre-placement classes with me, does not work and is home all weekend. I have been at the dollar store for 3+ years and usually have no problem working around my schedule for any reason. I do own 2 other older dogs at my house. The eldest is a 5 year old Coonhound. Though she is older, she can keep up with a little pup! The other is a 2 year old Cocker Spaniel/Pug mix who is a ball full of energy any time of day! I have worked out a plan with my roommate ( Brigitte Carrier-Auger) and my neighbor across the hallway (Jessie Burgess another GEB puppy raiser) for ""get busy"" breaks when I am unable to do so. Jessie and I have also arranged daily play dates to ensure the puppy will get the proper amount of physical and mental stimulation. My school's guidelines (Medaille College) is that the puppy must be 12 weeks of age and fully vaccinated before he can be on campus. Taking this into consideration, I would like to discuss the possibility of getting an older puppy (12 weeks of age) to expedite my raising experience. Thank you for this opportunity and I look forward to meeting my puppy."

On rare occasions, Jay leaves the house for up to a few hours during the day. Sometimes we run errands before or after dinner, but usually home by 8pm.

I think that living on a campus with a dog would be a great experience because there are many opportunities for socialization.  I am easily able to get back to my room between classes to take the puppy on bathroom breaks and for some exercise.  I have had experience puppy sitting, so a typical day for me is waking up at about 8:00am to take the puppy outside for about 30-45 minutes to ""get busy"" and some play time.  Then after getting ready for the day, I go to my classes for a few hours, and at lunch time I come back to my room.  During this time, I spent it by eating my lunch and then going for a walk throughout the campus with the puppy.  After a few more classes, I went to work and was able to bring the puppy with me.  Then I took him to the dining hall with me while I got some dinner and practiced some of his skills.  Not every day of the week for me looks like this, but I know that I am able to incorporate a puppy into my schedule nicely.

Generally the last person to leave our house for work leaves between 8 and 9am. One of us is always home by 5:30pm. Tina works from home frequently and has a large amount of flexibility to take care of the puppy's need to get busy every few hours. Andrew will also be able to come home from work when Tina is unable. It will be an adjustment for us but we are prepared for the puppy's needs. Our weekend schedule varies but we are usually in and out of the house all day (every few hours). We do travel every 1-2 months but often go on trips that would be dog friendly so we don't foresee that being an issue too often with needing to do excessive house swaps. We have 1 cat and 1 adult female labrador - age 7 - she is a rescue and we've had her for 3.5 years. Our lab really prefers the company of male dogs - we will be flexible with whatever works for GEB but if a male dog is an option, we think it will be a much smoother integration into our household. No life/job/baby changes planned. We live in a single family home in the suburbs. Our yard is not fenced but we walk our dog at least twice daily and have no issue with walking our pup frequently on a leash. It will never be left or put outside."

We have a large (coon hound mix) dog, 4 years old, who is quite energetic. Our first concern is how she will react to the puppy.  She has never been aggressive but can be excitable and needs a lot of activity during the day.  The household also has a 7 year old boy who, while energetic, is fairly calm and used to being around dogs.  He occasionally has friends visit which could create temporary chaos.  Weekends are flexible and usually involve multiple people who can be around.

I go to a kickboxing class from 5:30 to 6:30 (mon-thurs unless have something else scheduled) then come home, change and walk the dogs two miles, then feed them dinner and treats and spend some time hanging out with them.  On weekends, I walk the dogs when I get up.  we often have a ""play date"" with one of their friends in our yard (as it is fenced) and breakfast.  I go to kickboxing 9:30-10:30 on Saturday and then run some errand.  At home, I usually cook the dogs ""prescribed"" diet for the week (musroom, barley, chicken), and mow the lawn and do yard work on Saturday and/or Sunday. Then we do another walk before dinner. On Sunday I walk the dogs, then go to kickboxing 9-10.  I am training for a marathon and so do a longer walk on either Saturday or Sunday (this is for 3-6 hours on an increasing schedule up to the marathon in October).  We do an evening walk and eat dinner.  My older dog Sherlock is 13 and has kidney problems.  she is starting to have problems which mean a lot of vet trips and extra attention.

During a typical day during the school year, I am usually up at 530 and come downstairs to fix lunches and breakfast for Jackie. (Katie will be away at college).  I make coffee and then send Jackie off to school around 620. I feed our dog Cody and also let him out into our fenced yard to Get Busy! I then go for a walk or sometimes have coffee first and then go for a walk for about 1 hour.  Following that I usually read the paer and watch the news, a luxuary  of being retired.  At about 830-900 I usually get ready for the day's projects and get showered and dressed.  During any day I may work in the garden or do some kind of project around the house until about noon.  I break for lunch and then finish up whatever I was working on during the morning.  If I didn't get a walk in the morning done, I sometimes will go in the afternoon or evening.  Usually around 300 there is some sort of after school activity to be attending or driving to such as soccer games, skiing or concerts.  Then we head home for dinner and homework.  If time relax and then Jackie goes to bed around 10 and I follow around 11.  I also do volunteer work at our local food pantry but that schedule is flexible and varies through the month.  I am usually up around 630 ish and then read the paper and have coffee and plan for the events of the day.Weekends are usually driven by teen schedules of socialization and or shopping.  Being retired my days are flexible though I do follow the school schedule since Jackie is still in HS.  As I mentioned we do have another small dog, Cody who is a neutered male bishon frese mix.  He is 5 1/2 years old.  Was a rescue dog and loves other dogs much more than people.  He is very timid around other pepole.  We live in a rural neighborhood village and are walking distance to the school yard as well as state wet lands (bashakill)  Our home is two stories and we have a fenced in backyard.  As Katie is away at college in Vermont we do sometimes go and visit although it is usually for a weekend or short period of time.

I like to be active and i am very energetic. I don't like to sit around, I try to find things to do. On the weekend I am usually very free, I do homework, watch tv, play music, or just hang out with friends. I would like a really friendly puppy that doesn't mind being touched and played with. When I'm at home a have a cat and a chocolate lab that is friendly with other people and dogs"

I recently completed a Master's degree in the past week so my schedule for the past two years has basically been work, studying, and writing my thesis. On weekdays, I'm usually up by 6A and in the office by 8:30(-ish). I get home from work around 5P however I also live across the street from my office giving me flexibility on coming home during business hours. In the evening I'll usually go out for a run or bike ride for about an hour. I live in the Crystal City area so I often end up hanging out with friends in the Crystal City or Pentagon City area. On the weekends, my schedule is very fluid yet usually it's pretty quiet in the morning and often end up in DC at least one of the weekend days going to a museum or the Mall or hanging out with friends. I live in an apartment on the second floor however I have no neighbors to be concerned with. I hope this is enough detail but glad to answer any additional questions."
631,Primary,25794,0,,5NN13,Nitro,18031,05/23/13,I am a high school teacher.  I live 1 mile from work and have flexibility to leave during the day if needed to let a puppy out.  After work I regularly attend kids activities or sporting events that a puppy could attend.  My daughter will also be participating in training and can provide attention to a puppy if I am stuck late at work.  My ex wife lives nearby and has 2 days off during the week and is willing to check in on a puppy.  On the weekends we are active either going for hikes or other outings.  I do not work in the summer or during school breaks.  I live in a house with a large yard and nearby many walking trails or neighborhoods with sidewalks.
629,Primary,25793,0,,4PP13,Pete,18039,05/24/13,"Everyone at my house is very excited about raising a puppy.  During ten months of the year, I am a school teacher and keep a school schedule.  However, I do have some flexibilty and anticipate being able to come home for lunch so that the dog is never alone for too long.  Outside of school hours, including weekends and all summer, myself and my 3 kids will be available for puppy playing, socializing, and training.  We have an enclosed back yard for lots of puppy exercise.  We also have a semi-urban neighborhood and regularly walk around our town, whether to enjoy the weather, play at a park, or go get some ice cream.  We would offer the dog many different experiences in the course of our normal schedule: soccer games at the park, visiting friends with dogs, picking out books, or watching the street from our front porch.    Because of my work, I would love to get a puppy in the summer, so we could spend the mot time with it when it is young.  We have no preference, however, for type or gender.  Thanks!"

Most weekdays I walk in the mornings and then either participate in a Bible study or do some kind of volunteer work.  Piano students come to my home several afternoons each week.  The other afternoons I may sew, read, do housework, run errands, go to a class at the Y, etc.  I regularly attend a few evening events.  On Saturdays I enjoy outdoor activities or attending art or music festivals.  On Sundays I go to a church service and Sunday School class in the morning and a small home group in the evenings.  My husband is in the Air Force, and he will be deployed this year, leaving in June, so I will have more time to dedicate to raising a puppy.  (I previously raised puppies for Canine Companions for Independence, so I am aware of how much time needs to be dedicated to a puppy--especially a young puppy!)  I live in a two-story house (no other pets) in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of sidewalks, I will be able to take the puppy to most of my regular activities, and a crate will fit in the back of my car. I anticipate taking a two or three trips this year to visit friends and family, being gone either a few days or a week at a time.  In general, my schedule this year will be quite flexible."

659,Primary,25760,0,,6CC13,Clancey,17933,04/16/13,I am a college student and will be living in a small house next year with a few close friends (all of whom own dogs). Over the summer I will be living at home. I have a large yard and a small cocker spaniel who behaves well with other dogs. My days are very flexible and I spend a considerable amount of time outside whenever possible. I am extremely excited to be able to raise a puppy if I am approved as a raiser. I have ensured that my summer job understands I will not be able to work more than 3 hours without a break to go home and make sure the puppy is ok. I also checked with all my teachers for next year to ensure it would be ok to have the puppy in the classroom. I also designed my class schedule so that the puppy is not stuck inside for more than an hour at any time. I am young and active and absolutely love dogs and can't wait to help this amazing program by being a puppy raiser.
647,Primary,25739,0,,6AA13,Almond,17888,04/26/13,"I usually wake up between 5:30 and 6:00 am. It takes me about an hour to get ready for work and I don't have to leave for work until 7:45. I have about a 10 minute drive and work from 8-5. I go home everyday during my lunch hour, which is from 12-1. During that time I am usually home for about 40 minutes. I then return from work for the evening at about 5:10. I do have dog training classes at Petco Tuesday and/or Thursday nights (depending on whether or not anyone has signed up for the class). The class isn't until 7 so I would have enough time to exercise and interact with the pup after my day job before teaching the class. I am also able to bring the pup to my classes with me, as long as that would be okay with Guiding Eyes. This would depend on the individual class (whether it was a big or small class, and the dogs in it) and it would depend on the comfort level of the pup.  I understand the importance of not putting pressure on the pup to enter situations they are not yet comfortable with and I also understand the need to be able to pay close attention to the pup so I know when they are moving out of the Think and Learn zone. The class is only an hour long so I am usually home by 8:15. I go to bed anywhere between 9:00 and 10:00.   On nights that I do not have to work I like to keep busy and like to be outside. I often go to local parks to take my dog for a walk or I have a couple friends who live downtown whose houses I will park at and they will join me for a walk. My mom sometimes joins me on these walks too, which would give me the option of bringing my dog along with the pup if I wanted. My dog is getting older and tires more easily so I do foresee leaving her home many nights, especially because its important to have lots of one on one time with the pup.   My weekends are very similar to my free week nights. I do hold a 1 hour seminar every other Sunday at Petco, but other than that my schedule is open. I live out in the country and my family owns a lot of property so I like to be outside doing things around the yard, walking the trails, or go for walks in the city and take advantage of the different events going on.    My mom has offered to help out with the pup as much as possible and my brother is also currently available during the day to help out. They both live two houses down from me (there's actually a trail through fields and woods our family owns that connects the two properties). I also plan on taking a week off when I get a pup so that I have time to help the pup adjust and establish a routine. This time will help me get a good idea of if and when the pup will need to be let out or exercised while I am at work."

681,Primary,25737,0,,9BB13,Brandy,17926,04/10/13,"We live in Raleigh about a mile or so from North Hills and Crabtree Valley.  Our home is on a quiet cul-de-sac with sidewalks.  Most of the houses are on 1/3-1/2 acre lots.  Our backyard is fenced in with lots of birds and squirrels.  We are just steps from the Raleigh Greenway, which provides miles of paved walking trails.      Our lifestyle is rather laid back.  Gail is a retired English teacher.  She works 9-2 Monday-Thursday at a church downtown.  She is 10 minutes from home.  She exercises regularly at the gym.  However, with a puppy she would make her gym membership inactive and change her exercise program to walking (and working/playing) with the dog in the afternoons.  There is also adequate time for the pup before we leave for work.  Gail also enjoys working outside.     David works full-time at the Secretary of State‚Äôs office downtown.  He is usually away from home on weekdays from 7:30-5:30.  He is very active on the weekends and on afternoons playing disc golf.      Together we have four sons.  None live at home.  There are no grandchildren‚Ä¶only the children in the neighborhood.    We are usually home on the weekends.  We are hardly ever away overnight.  If we are away, it is for short periods only‚Ä¶going to church, visiting Grandmother, for instance.  We are home almost every evening with the exception of choir rehearsal (Gail) or occasion meeting or movie.       All the years we had dogs, we thought, ‚ÄúWhen the dogs are gone, we‚Äôll be able to do [this or that] or travel.‚Äù  However, over the past 2 years we have noticed that our lifestyle did not change.  We just love to be around home.      Our health is good and we are active.  The opportunity to raise a Guiding Eye pup will be good for us and good for the pup.  We want the activity and joy that a dog brings to a home, but we do not want the extreme sadness that goes along with raising a dog to old age only to grieve when it dies as our beagles did.  But we believe that we can be really good ‚Äúfoster parents.‚Äù  Yes, seeing the pup leave us will be hard, but this dog‚Äôs purpose is not to be our life-long companion.  This dog has a greater purpose, a higher calling.      The son of one of our friends lost his sight as a teenager to a brain tumor several years ago.  He has become amazingly independent.   He leaves next week for New Jersey to meet his new dog and to learn how his life will change with his new companion.  We are so thrilled for him.  His family and friends are so grateful to the people who made this possible for him.      We believe that we can offer a pup a good home and a good foundation in order to help someone who deserves a more independent life."

She does not live with me but understands the responsibility of raising a pup for GEB.  I have a large backyard but no fence around the yard.  I have my own business so my schedule is mostly flexible.  The pup would have exposure to a variety of business environments traveling with me as I work.  Generally, I am up for work between 7:00-7:30am.  I arrive at work between 8:00am-9:00am.   Once a month I have a committee meeting from 8:00am-10:00 am.  I would take the pup to work and leave it crated during this meeting.  I also have a once a month evening meeting and the pup would be able to join me at those meetings.    Every other Saturday from September through February I volunteer for a business class from 8:00am-11:30am.  My niece would care for the pup at these times or the pup could come to class on occasion.  Other than that I have a normal life with friends and family going out at times.  My niece and I are committed to meeting the needs of the pup at all times.

Most of our neighbors have dogs and cats as pets. Joppa Road is only 2 miles away, so we can quickly reach suburban and urban areas to provide the puppy with a variety of experiences. We have 3 grown sons who visit occasionally. I work from home as a consultant (computer work) with a completely flexible schedule, so working with the puppy throughout the day (and night!) will not pose a problem for me. I occasionally travel for my work, 1-2 times a year for a few days each time. Garry works at Union Memorial Hospital from 7 am to 4 pm on weekdays. We vacation for a week at a time perhaps once or twice a year. We have 2 adult dogs, 8-year-old Bear and 6-year-old Cocoa, who are Lab mutts. The dogs are trained to an electric fence around our property. We have installed a small fenced-in area (about 20 ft. square) that leads off one of the back doors of our house, so the adult dogs can play outside with the puppy safely (under supervision, of course!) before he is old enough to be trained on the electric fence. We have 4 adult cats who are used to the dogs. We usually walk the dogs twice a day for 1-1.5 miles each time.

During the week JJ works in DC and typically leaves the house around 5:45a so he can take the puppy out to get busy early in the morning before he leaves for work. He returns home around 4:45p. Occasionally he also has the opportunity to work from home. The first half of this year he has been involved in a lot of travel for work but due to the program he will be home a lot more starting at the end of May. Rachel has a more flexible schedule and is able to work from home a majority of the time. She typically goes into her office either in DC or Alexandria, 2-3 days a week for 6-8 hours. She doesn‚Äôt leave until 7:30 so the puppy will be out again, fed, and let out a final time and crated before she leaves. When the puppy is ready, it will go to work with her on those days. Prior to that, our neighbor‚Äôs son, who will be home on vacation from college, lives ¬æ mile away and will be available to let the puppy out and feed between 10:30-11:30. Rachel is usually home by 2:30. In the afternoons/evenings during the week we tend to stay low key with an occasional activity one or two nights a week. We will go to the gym or go on a run in the park. Although we will have to be more conscious of our timing, we do have a 5 year old German Shepherd (Harper) who we have make sure gets adequate exercise and try to incorporate her into our plans as much as possible (As we will with the puppy). On the weekends, we stay fairly busy however we are lucky to live in a very dog-friendly town where even pets are welcome out and in stores. We enjoy taking Harper with us hiking, to the park or to the beach. We do like to take weekend trips once or twice a month but when we do travel, it is normally no more than three hours away and we normally take Harper with us. We live in a single level ranch home with a finished basement (with carpeted stairs).

688,Primary,25624,0,,7F512,Frolic,17531,04/02/13,"We believe that we are well suited and ready to raise a Guiding Eyes puppy as soon as possible.  I will be finished for the semester May 10th, so will be able to devote lots of time towards working with the young puppy.  We have a rescue dog, Piper, who is a Black Mouth Cur mix from All Breed Rescue.  We have had her since Oct 9th, 2011.  She will be 2yrs April 15th.  Normally during the week we are up between 6 and 630 either getting ready for school, work, or the 2yr old little boy is coming and let the dog to go out to go potty.  I always take Piper for a walk whether it is just out back for a 15-20 min walk if I have an early class to make, or if I don‚Äôt have an early class we will go to Mills Riverside Park and go up in the woods, usually a 1-2hr walk/hike.  My mom is usually always home unless she has an appointment or shopping to do, if so she is only gone for a few hours.   Three days out of the week she takes care for her niece‚Äôs son who is 2yrs old, usually 7:30am to about 5pm at the latest. Ethan is at school from 730am-3pm.  My dad is at work from 7am to 5:30pm.  I usually work 3 days out of the week from 10-4.  I usually will take Piper to the park again for another walk with friends around 4 for about an hour, hour and half.  We usually have dinner between 5 -6:30.  Sometimes depending on the weather I may walk Piper in our neighbor hood for about 30min.  Then we all normally go to bed around 10pm.  Then on the weekend we are even more flexible and don‚Äôt do too much.  Getting up can be the same when the puppy comes, but usually sleep in a bit till 7-7:30.  We usually I will take Piper for walk out back in the morning when we get up and then another walk later in the afternoon and maybe once more after dinner.  Usually Gary (my dad) will go to the dump and grocery shopping.  During the winter we usually go skiing on Sundays from 8-4.       	We live in a good size neighborhood with houses not super close to each other.  We have about a 1acre lot, with lots of open area and some woods in the front.  Like I said above, there is a path behind our house with a field and woods to walk.  In a neighboring neighborhood there are more paths and woods to walk in.  We live close by to the elementary, middle and high schools.  There are sidewalks we plan on driving too to walk there for practice.    	It will be easy to make the puppy a part of our family.  We will love being able to take it to soccer games, on car rides to places, walk places, go downtown Burlington with it.  We have a very flexible schedule to fit it into our daily lives and to meet the requirements need to socialize, train, and love this puppy.  My mom or I will be able to exercise it and train it in the morning before I leave or the baby comes.  She will be able to correct and praise the dog in the house with the 2yr and also be able to give it kennel time while still near the puppy.  My mom or I will be home to feed it and take it out every 20-30 minutes if it is out wandering or after it comes out of the kennel.  Ethan will be home around 3 and will be able to play and exercise the puppy and take it out.  When I get home from work I will also be able to train and work with it, play and exercise it, and feed it dinner.   Once we are home we are usually home for the night, so being able to exercise/play with the puppy before time for bed is doable.  I will get up in the middle of the night to make the 3-4hr time to take it out to ‚ÄúGet Busy‚Äù.

Later the boys do their after school sports, then I provide dinner (not always prepared by me - sometimes the guy at the deli prepares dinner!) then homework, recreational  time and then bed.  Bedtime depends on how late kids are studying and can go until midnight.  Our activity on the weekends is generally high, although we do like and need to make most of our down time.  The house can get very quiet when we know we have nowhere to go and nothing to do.   We have a family of boys and they strongly agree we should have a male puppy (don't ask).  My teenage boys are active and excited about participating in the program, so I expect the puppy will get plenty of exercise and a lot of care from them.  We live in a single family home with a large deer-fenced yard.  Like all suburban volunteers, in order to introduce him to the rest of the world, the puppy will be in and out of the car.

We are both very recently retired, still adjusting to the blessing of free time!  Bernie still does part time consulting occasionally, from home.  I might look for something part time, close to home, but have no immediate plans.  We expect to be home, at least one of us, most times. We travel only occasionally, have lots of hobbies and interests.  Gardening, handcrafts, woodworking, church, community involvement, etc.   We usually get up early (even earlier with a pup!), and have a neighborhood where we can walk safely, which we do often.  There are no sidewalks, but most areas are very safe for walking. We do our usual chores through out the day, walk to get the mail from our post office, sometimes go out to eat, but also like to cook/bake and eat at home.   We have nice family gatherings from time to time, home and away (nearby).  We are fortunate to live a happy and peaceful life, and look forward to the opportunity to successfully raise an impressionable young dog and teach the basics it will need to provide such an important service later in it's life.

749,Primary,25570,0,,5K13,Kasha,17695,03/10/13,"I live in a rural area.Own my own home and live there alone with two pets. Most days of the week my schedule can be flexible since I sell real estate and a pup would be welcome in my office. I also work in a supermarket part time. My employer will allow me to bring a puppy to keep in a private area of the store where I spend a lot of my time.  I have a cat and a 14 year old male cocker spaniel who has always been very good with other dogs even though he has not spent any time with a young puppy.  I feel I have the time to provide a puppy with the love, training and experience it will need during it's young life to suceed in fullfilling it's final destiny. I fill this is a very worthy project and I feel very blessed with the opportunity to serve.  My biggest fear is probably the same as every other puppy raiser, giving up the pup when it is time for IFT, but I know the pup has a job to do and a greater calling to answer to."
748,Primary,25543,0,,8H13,Houston,17676,03/10/13,"OK. Our lifestyle: Tony (my husband) runs the Jamestown 4-H Center. We live about 30 minutes away and will occasionally spend days there and have the opportunity to interact with all kinds of people and participate in a lot of activities. I am home with our four children that we homeschool. Our children's ages are 8yrs, 7yrs, 5yrs, and 3yrs.  Since we homeschool we are home a lot. We have a nice sized, fenced-in backyard that the kids spend a lot of time in. Three of our children LOVE dogs. We had our own dogs, but in the past year have had to put both of them down. Our kids are the kind who will lay on the floor petting and loving on the dog. I would prefer a dog with a more calm temperament.  We live on the end of a cul-de-sac in a small town. It's fairly quiet with little to no traffic.. Several of our neighbors have dogs.   Weekends we go to church on Sunday and do AWANA. It's probably the day we are out the most.  During the weekday afternoons we tend to be running around to piano lessons, woodworking class, homeschool group, bible study. We would like to think that we could bring the pup (once they get a little older to many of these things) I have already received some permissions.    We have been in this area for 4.5yrs and don't have any plans on moving any time soon. We have family in NJ and try to travel there about once every 8 weeks or so. We also have a pop-up camper and try to go camping at least one weekend each month. We are hoping that it is OK to take our pup with us for these trips?  Our dogs have always just traveled with us everywhere.  I guess we would also request a pup that doesn't mind being in the car because we are about 30 mins from just about everything, and it will be over an hour drive to get to our GEB class each week.  We have been prepping our kids for some time about getting a GEB pup.    We began about 10 months ago with reading some books; like Follow My Leader and Through Otis' Eyes. Watching documentaries, etc...  As far as exercising; I will be walking our dog each morning, playing in the yard with the kids (like hide & seek and fetch), and my husband usually does shorter evening walks and running/biking on the weekends.  If we can avoid a dog with a strong prey drive/ a chaser, that would help me with the kids in the yard as they tend to run around a ton.  That's all I can think of. We are planning on getting our own pup when our GEB pup is about a year old if everything is working out. We are looking at female Golden Retrievers. For our GEB pup we were going to ask if we could have a female shepherd or a female yellow lab. Of course we would be happy to raise any pup that you think is the best match for our family."

We do go do some outside activities but many of them would be fine for the puppy to come with us.  In the summer we're at our neighborhood pool much of the day and the puppy might need to be home with my mom more than me.  This fall I hope to be taking some community college courses so can't take the puppy there with me--maybe I could sometimes?  It will be a big adjustment for me so I don't know for sure yet."

I work in an office environment but telecommute from home two days a week (Tues, Thurs). My expectations would be to bring the puppy into work on Mon, Wed, Fri when old enough. The primary handler would be me. My daughter would be secondary (and be attending the weekly classes with me). My wife would be there to add support as needed. We take a couple vacations a year. Either bringing the puppy along, or coordinating a  home swap with another puppy-raiser would be great."

I generally walk a mile every morning after rising and then return to the house for breakfast, and reading (newspapers/books).  Some days I volunteer at a local food pantry perhaps once a month, but otherwise my daytime schedule centers on reading, home improvement projects, house maintenance projects, and errands.  In the summer I may go for a mid-day swim and also an evening swim at our local pool club.  In the winter I might do the mid-day swim if I re-join the gym at a local college.  If I take another class in January my activity will likely focus on class readings, etc. Evenings are devoted to meal preparation/cleanup, F2F conversation with Paula over dinner and for me, typically watching a sporting event or movie on tv if I do not have a scheduled meeting or class.  The evening classes are usually no more than one evening per week.  These classes vary and depend upon my free time and interest level.  I also occasionally have evening meetings for organizations that I support e.g. a church committee meeting, and I also serve on the board of a local organization ‚Äì Hilltop Hanover Farm.  These groups meet no more frequently than once monthly for a 2-3 hour period. I attend choir practice weekly 1+ hours in the evening.  These absences from the home can generally be covered by my wife Paula who works from home and could be with the pup for feeding, and other exercise and outside activities.    On weekends we both attend to Saturday errands some of which could develop into training exercises. We typically socialize with friends on Saturday evening, e.g. dining out, hosting a dinner party, or seeing a movie. On Sunday we are typically both at church.  I go early for choir rehearsal and then depending on what is happening typically stay a bit afterwards for our coffee hour.  This entire period of time would be between 2-3 hours.  I could see this experience also being a training exercise for the pup as he/she gets older so that the pup can be acquainted with different sounds and people contact.  We have no other pets at home and our children are grown.  In fact, one is engaged and will marry in March 2013.  This is a one week trip in mid-to-late March 2013 that will require international travel. We live in a private residence.    On the health front I am in good health at age 62, however I will be consulting an orthopedist soon for slight knee pain.  Depending upon the results I may require minor knee surgery, but that is not known at this point -- just a worse-case scenario.    In closing, I will be the primary puppy handler and believe that my schedule is flexible and can be adapted with minimal adjustment to the needs of a Guiding Eyes puppy and the requirements of being a puppy raiser.

I also visit her home in Pawling about once a month  I spend my summers in Maine on Lake Parlin ( central Maine). I plan to travel to Guiding Eyes in Maine July/Aug  I have made arrangements to travel to Italy Oct 4-12, 2013 with my two adult daughters  My condo is on one level,   surrounded by trees and lawn, large areas to walk but no sidewalks. In socializing my pup I would take her to Mt Kisco, Katonah, Pawling, Brewster etc.  Somers is opening a dog park in the Spring 2013 which I would visit,following the GEB regulations."

He has a flexible work schedule.     We have children (ages 5 and 6). We have 3 dogs (2 are ages 10+ and 1 is 4).

My kids and their friends play a lot outside after school and on the weekends.    We're from California and visit 2x a year. We generally don't go anywhere else.     My kids have grown up with dogs and went through the puppy stage with one of our dogs. The kids love to play with our younger dog. The younger dog also loves the kids. The older dogs love to cuddle with the kids when they're watching TV or reading books.     We've fostered some homeless puppies recently, and everyone (including the dogs) did fine. The last dog was 6 months old. It took a week or so for one of the older dogs to adjust, but he was accepting after a period of time. Our younger dog loved the last puppy and seemed depressed after he found a home.      One of my dogs barks, but the others don't.    The bottom line is that our schedule, epecially mine, is pretty flexible and there will be plenty of time to socialize the puppy."

Also, she  has colitis and poops outside the box occasionally.The older one is very calm, patient and tolerant, and never misbehaves. He is rarely anxious and very adventurous.    Our home is  very quiet, peaceful and calm though we have a bathroom remodel scheduled to begin in early July, which is expected to last about 4-5 weeks. We live in a somewhat urban setting, near the Shaker Lakes Parks, with neighbors nearby on all sides.  We have large front and back yards, in which we see deer and foxes occasionally (a newly discovered family of 4) and lots of the usual wildlife, like birds, squirrels and chipmunks. We also live just 2 houses away from a very busy street, Lee Rd., so there is a lot of street noise, including fairly frequent and loud sirens from the Police station that is just a 5 minute walk away.    My husband and I are both very healthy; I would be the primary handler and am very active, with a learning style like a puppy's: short, frequent and repetitious attention when  learning a task, with lots of positive feedback works best for me, so I understand how and why it would work well for a puppy.

When i get home which is usually around 4:30, I will be able to take over responsibilty of the pup. I go to bed around 9:30 to 10:00. I live in an independent suburban home.

I have always wanted a dog, but told myself I wouldn't have one until I was sure I could take care of it. Now that I have been retired for 3 years and my children are older, I think now is a good time. I recognize that a potential 15 year commitment may be a little agressive since I don't know what I will be getting into. I think raising a GEB puppy will give me the proven knowledge to raise a puppy successfully. Just reading the materials makes me sure that If this was my own puppy, I would be proud of his behaviors when I took him somewhere.     We live in a townhouse with a family next to us in the same building and neighbors in the next building about 25 feet away. The folks in the same building have no dogs, but 3 indoor cats. They have 2 children...a 6 year old girl and a 1 year old boy. The ones in the building next to us is adopting an 11 year old girl this summer and they have a very obnoxious chihuahua. They don't leash their dog and I anticipate it being a problem at some point this summer. The folks across the street have a 3 year old Puggle and the unit attached to them have a beagle and a terrier and 3 cats. The cats are always roaming the neighborhood and the beagle is never leashed.     I am home all day unless I am doing errands...grocery shopping, pick up a script, stop at the bank, Dunkin Donuts for breakfast, etc. There is no reason the pup wouldn't/couldn't go with me everytime I leave the house. I volunteer at the local middle school on Thursdays and they have already said it would be OK if the pup came with me after he is house trained. My son has already checked with the high school and they have said he could have show and tell days there so the puppy if exposed to about 1500 kids moving in the aisles after each class.    We have a camp for the summer. We would take the dog to camp with us. The camp is right on the water so he could swim. We have a 60 foot dock and a boat which he could certainly ride with us. The neighbors there are very good. One has a 13 year old yellow lab and the other is rarely there. Their nephew come now and then and has a Rotweiller.  We are at camp 4 to 5 days a week during the summer...mid-April to late October.    We are planning a cruise April 2013, usually gone for 7-9 days, so would need a sitter during that time.    I would like a female yellow lab, on the whiter side if possible. I would like to request that the name isn't Sue, Susan, or Suzanne as my wifes name was Susan and while I wouldn't have any trouble with those names, out of respect for my in-laws  I don't think those names would be appropriate.    I am a morning person whereas my sons are more afternoon to evening/night. I would hope for a puppy who isn't high energy, but one who doesn't mind moving and going out and learning new things."

I volunteer with him as a and trained him as a therapy dog . We visit people in the hospital once a week. He is very submissive and can be scared of larger dogs. He is particularly scared of high energy dogs. He is never aggressive but generally seems scared that he will be stepped on. We would prefer a calmer dog because this. I do feel that if he gets to know the dog  when he/she is a puppy (therefore smaller) he will get along better with the dog.

Since she is a older dog  we give in a treat het, even though she hasn't done her business every time. My wife reads for a while then goes to bed at nine. I check our son's homework and he's in bed by ninethiry, lights out at te. I'll watch TV for a half hour and go to bed about ten thirty.

1072,Primary,24152,0,,3P411,Payson,16768,02/07/12,"I am working on a master's degree in library science online.  I am taking classes full-time and I am not working so that I can get through the master's program more quickly.  I am not planning to get a job until I am finished with the degree.  I will graduate in December or next May, and will hopefully find a job in a library afterward.  In my experience library jobs tend to offer fairly flexible schedules, and when the time comes I don't foresee a problem with accommodating the pup's needs.  For now, though, my schedule is almost entirely flexible.    I wake up in the morning anywhere between 8:30 and 10:30, but I will adapt this to fit the puppy‚Äôs schedule.  I sleep later now because I don‚Äôt have to be a certain place by a certain time, but with a pup to look after, this would be different.  I wake up, have breakfast, read for a little while to give myself time to wake up, and then take a shower and get ready for the day.  My day is pretty simple because I spend most of my time reading textbooks, writing papers, and working on assignments during the day.  Usually I go to Starbucks or the library to study for a couple of hours in the morning or afternoon (one or the other). While the pup is on a schedule where he needs to go out every hour or so, I plan to stay at home during the day to attend to his bathroom needs.  I could study at Starbucks again occasionally when the pup is old enough to stay in a crate for a few hours, but I can study effectively at home so this isn‚Äôt a requirement.  If I don‚Äôt go to Starbucks to study, I like to go on a walk around downtown White Plains, go on an errand to the grocery store or Target, or go to the gym downstairs.  These activities each usually take about an hour.    Michael gets home around six in the evenings, and we usually have dinner between six and eight.  We watch a TV show or read in the evenings, and I spend time knitting or working on homework.  I have class from 6-10 pm on Mondays and Thursdays, and I have to concentrate most of my attention on class during this time.  Michael is home by the time class starts or shortly thereafter.  He can take responsibility for the puppy on those nights.  Once or twice a week we go out for a few hours in the evening to go to a movie or hang out with friends‚Äîthis is of course flexible.  On weekends we bake, run errands, go for walks, and do chores around the house.  For example, we might go to a yarn store or the grocery store.  Sometimes we visit NYC for the day.  We don‚Äôt need to do this until the puppy is old enough to handle it, and we could spend shorter periods of time there so as not to overwhelm him.  We usually take the train but driving the car is an option, too.  We are both very willing to plan our activities around the puppy‚Äôs needs and as you can see, my schedule in particular is very flexible.    I left my car in Atlanta, and I‚Äôm planning to leave it there at least until the ice and snow driving season is over.  I can walk everywhere I need to go during the day: the grocery store, Target, bookstore, Starbucks, library, etc. are all within easy walking distance.  Michael has a car and will be able to take the puppy and me where we need to go.  It‚Äôs also an option for me to drive him to work and use the car during the day‚Äîas long as it‚Äôs not snowing.  The puppy will be able to get used to riding in a car.    We live on the sixth floor of an apartment building in White Plains.  I don‚Äôt really know our neighbors, but they‚Äôre quiet.  Other dogs live in our building, so hopefully we will pick up some tips in class about how to handle running into these dogs on our way outside.  We have a one-bedroom apartment.  I will have time to take the dog on walks during the day so he won‚Äôt be too hyper or feel cooped up inside.    The main thing that I wanted to talk to you about is that one of the conditions of my move to New York was that I would be able to visit my family in Atlanta occasionally.  I am very close to my mom, so it is important to me to be able to see her.  Michael and I had planned for me to fly to Atlanta approximately once every two months or so.  Since I can continue my class work there, I had planned to spend about a week there at a time.  It is important to me that I am able to visit with my family sometimes, but I will make it a priority to plan these trips in the best interest of the puppy.  Michael and I have thought about options to take care of the puppy‚Äôs needs in this situation.  With all the dogs in our apartment building, we could find a responsible dog walker to let the dog out at lunchtime if this is acceptable to Guiding Eyes.  If not, Michael could come home during his lunch break if necessary.  Also, I don‚Äôt know what the Guiding Eyes policy is on bringing puppies on airplanes once they are old enough to handle it, but if Guiding Eyes and the airline would allow it, I‚Äôd be willing to bring the dog with me so he would have experience with flying.  My priority is to plan visiting around the puppy‚Äôs needs.    Finally, I‚Äôd like to request that we get a Lab rather than a German Shepherd if possible.  I have allergies, and allergy medicine helps enough that I am fine around Labs (my family‚Äôs dog, Ivy, is a Lab) but I don‚Äôt think I would do as well with a German Shepherd.    I tried to include everything I could think of about what my life is like--hopefully I didn't write too much!  Please call or email if you have any questions or want to discuss anything!  Thanks :)"
1070,Primary,24149,0,,1P411,Paulette,16766,02/08/12,"I am not working now, so I am home during the days during the week as well as weekends. My typical week involves several periods of time commitment. I take classes Tues and Thurs evenings and Sunday afternoon.  I am typically away from the apartment 2-3 hours for these periods. I also exercise in the mornings, two to three times per week, although the days and times vary. I am usually exercising first thing in the morning, typically starting sometime between 7:15AM and 8:30AM. The duration is usually 30mins to an 1.5 hours, I also am out of the house mid-day on Tues and Thurs, usually for an 1-2 hours. Outside of those commitments, my remaining time is open and flexible. We have a dog already and we live near the park, so we are in the park at least twice daily for anywhere from half and hour to an hour with our dog; weekend days are typically longer. We live in a 3rd floor apartment and often take the stairs down and ride a small elevator up to our apartment. The apartment is one bedroom so we spend almost all of our time in the front room, which is fairly open and sizeable (for NYC). If not in the front room, we are in the ktichen, which is fairly small.    My wife and I expect to travel periodically to Boston, so we would be traveling in a car with the dog periodically as well.    The timing of my return to work is uncertain. If I were to return to the same field, which is yet to be determined, my evenings can be interrupted unexpectedly, although the frequency of these occassions is low, but have flexibility of time during the days."

Sundays we go to church in the morning then grocery shop around noon. We eat family dinner when the kids get home from work, usually around 5 or 6. Our daughter will invite friends over to watch TV in the evening. My husband and I are usually in bed by 11 every night.

My husband and I do have a gym membership and we go about 2 evenings a week for about an hour each time. We sound very busy but we have a lot of time to relax too. With the exception of my work, the puppy would be involved in everything I do but limited on what my husband does as he would not be taking the puppy to work--he works in a warehouse with semi trucks and other equipment that he would not be able to maintain control of a dog while doing his job. I work as a computer tech support person in a business office, so I have more opportunity for teaching moments that would be safe for the puppy."

Terry will take the puppy to work with her, frequently taking him from his crate for training and exercise.  Ann will work with the puppy after school and in the evening.  Bill and Terry will work with the puppy again in the evening, taking the puppy for a long walk before bedtime.  We have another dog, Frampton, a 3/4 Golden Retriever 1/4 Poodle mix who is a seven year old male who expects to be walked and played with daily.  Frampton is not particulalry good with other dogs, usually barking at the initial meeting.  However, he does settle down quickly and accepts the other dog.   We live in a two story house in the Village of East Aurora.  We have a large kitchen/family room where we spend most of our time.  This area is closed off from the rest of the house which will make it easier to monitor the puppy's behavior.  Our location in the village will allow us to have many socialization opportunities.  We are all in good shape physically so will not have a problem exercising the dog.  We plan on taking him to local parks and for hikes.  Terry's parents are in a senior living facility and she stops by to check on them frequently and will be taking the puppy with her.  We are concerned that there is not much diversity in our village, so we are planning on taking the puppy into the city for more socialization activities.

I am usually in and out throughout the day.  I work parttime, setting up my own hours, often just a few a day.  After school, there is usually a teenager doing homework or going for a run or to a sports practice. Although we are very active, our home is situated in a very quiet dead end neighbor hood with four other houses.  There are a few other dogs around, including our three year old lab, but only one other child who often stops in to say hello.  We are adjacent to Water Company Land as well as State Forest.  We have very little traffic.  On weekends we are often atttending our children's soccer games or other sporting events.         Our oldest son, Sam, has autism and loves dogs.  He is not overly affectionate with his dogs but rather simply enjoys their company.  Our dogs have been essential companions for Sam, it seems to work for them.  Thus, we are extremely  interested in the Heeling Autism program!        Given our somewhat rural location, we realize that we will be taking our pup to other locations for socialization etc.  We are very excited to be part of GEB!!!"

Have a big fenced in back yard 10,000 sq.ft. Lots of neighbors have friendly dogs too who will want to come to meet puppy and maybe play.  Sue and I have both been around dogs our whole lives and we have had many dogs of various sizes and breeds during our 40 plus years of marriage. Our two children are both married and live in Maryland, with our daugter having a loving dog who visits often or we go to their house to stay for 4 or 5 days.  Our daily routine is just that - a daily routine that follows a very predictable pattern.  We like to go out to eat maybe once a week and shop for groceries once a week. We take trips to B.J.'s or Costco about every 6 weeks.  We have no real preference for a particular breed or sex of dog. We are real animal lovers and we both seem to speak dog fluently. Am looking forward to the experience."

Apart from taking care of house and family, I really enjoy working with horses. I spend time at the barn almost every day. We have Nina, 11, and Ben, 8 years old, both of them are looking forward to help with the puppy. Our family also consists of three rescue dogs. Clyde, the oldest is 15 and in surprisingly good health and spirit. He is the king, he doesn't have the strength to reinforce it but it typically just takes a look from him to get the favorite dog bed to himself. Next is Kya, 12 years old and the lowest on the ladder among the dogs. Youngest is Molly 5 or 6 years old, she is a certified search and rescue dog, working in team with my husband. All three of them are collie/shepherd/??? mixes.  We take weekend trips to our cabin in the Catskills and go to Sweden for 2-3 weeks every summer. We live in a single family home with a little less than 1 acre fenced in yard. We live in a neighborhood outside Brewster.  My M-F days looks similar to each other and go like this. 6.20 am- wake up and prepare lunch for both children, the oldest leaves on the bus at 7.10 am. If Rick is traveling or doesn't have time then I make sure that the dogs get to relieve them self in the backyard.  8 am-breakfast with Rick and Ben, feed the dogs, make sure that Ben gets on the bus right before 9am.  9 am - walk the dogs, 1 mile or 3 mile circle.  10 am - leave for the barn.  Noon-2pm - back from the barn, grocery shopping, house chores, errands etc  2.30 pm-pick up Nina, bring her to the barn  Either pick up Ben at his dismissal or greet him at home 4.20 pm. Home work, dinner, pick up daughter, soccer practice. Our dogs eat their dinner around 7pm. they typically go out the last time around 10 pm right before we go to bed. The afternoon schedule varies during the weekdays depending on the kids' activities. We let the dogs out/take them on walks as we come and go. Sometimes the dogs, one by one or all of them, come with me to the barn. I like to take walks in the woods there.  The weekend schedule varies. We sleep in a little bit, go to the barn, take hikes, work around the house, soccer games.  I hope this helped. I realized that my schedule is difficult to pinpoint since I'm lucky enough not to have to be at work certain times. It also depends on if Rick is home working or traveling. He makes sure the dogs get to go out regularly during the day. I hope this helps."

In addition to attending puppy raising classes, I also have guitar and arthritis classes each week. Each calls for roughly 3 hours absence from home.  Weather permitting, I play golf (9 holes) twice a week.  Presently I go to the gym twice a week; in the winter it will be three or four.   Two to four times a month we attend musical or theatrical performances - requiring a 4 to 5 hour absence.  Once or twice a week I do volunteer driving to take elderly persons and others without transport to medical appointments.  A couple of times a month we visit my mother in Bloomfield - near Hartford.  Usually twice a year we take an out-of-country vacation for about 2 weeks each.  In the last 6 months I've developed a number of medical conditions/issues with feet and knees:  * arthroscopic surgery on left knee  * mild arthritis in left knee  * osteoarthritis in right knee  * broken accessory cuboid bone in left foot  * partial tendon tear in left foot  * tendonitis in both feet  * very recent onset on sciatica  The above conditions (some of which are improving) limit my ability to bend and twist."

Everyone is out of the house between 6:30 & 8:30.  The kids begin returning home around 2:30 & usually everyone is home by 6:30.  In the winter, we go back out for hockey practice & get back after 11:00.  On the weekends we tend to stay home & relax.  We don't leave town many times during the year.  When we go to visit family we take our dog with us.  We would have to determine if this works with the GEB pup.  We have 3 kids, the oldest graduated from UCONN this past spring & has recently found a job and for now is living at home.  The other two are a junior & senior in high school.  They are both involved in sports, and we are avid supporters of their sports.  We go to hockey games, soccer games & lacrosse games often.  Often the non participating kid stays home, so there is often someone home.  We have an 8 month old puppy.  He is a bernese, newfoundland mix.  His name is Harley, so it would probably be important not to have a GEB pup with a similar name.  We would prefer to have a male.  Harley is scheduled to be neutered in the next week."

In the mornings I also clean the house put on Laundry and check emails. My other daily tasks are running errands such as shopping. My other activities that I do on a regular basis is attend a sewing group once a week, I try to hit golf balls or play golf, I attend my Group MAWA where we have a pot-luck luncheon once a month, or I catch up with friends for a walk and coffee. Other than that my time is quite flexible.  The kids start coming home at 2.45-3.30 pm they have various after school activites that I need to get them too and these vary each day and change throughout the year depending on the sport season. 6.30 pm we are normally home for dinner, the kids then get ready for bed at 8.00 pm. I then watch TV, sew or read until 10.30 pm when I retire to bed. My husbands job requires that we occasionally are required to attend evening functions, but the kids are at an age where they stay at home on their own. These functions occur about 3-4 times a month. Our 14 year old son is taking a very active role in this process and I feel confident that he will be able to step up to help with the Pup. As we are living temporarily in the US, we do intend to travel, our next trip away is booked for January 28th for a week, but we do from time to time head away on weekends, and it would be our intention if permission is given to take the dog away with us overnight, usually we travel 3-4 hrs away.

He should be rehabbed within eight weeks.  Otherwise, we are both physically active.         We are very sociable people.  We enjoy going out to restaurants in the evenings, usually about three times per week.  We entertain friends in our home often, usually at least once per month, up to ten people at a time.  At Halloween and for the Kentucky Derby we have big parties, up to 30 or more people in our home.  For that reason, a less hyper puppy is probably best for these settings.         We have Browns season tickets and go to all of the games.         We have a swimming pool that our dogs enjoy with us.  We have a large fenced in back yard.         One of our labs is a female that has not been spayed because she has a heart valve problem and anesthesia could compromise her health.  She goes in heat every six months.  Therefore, it may be better that we have a female puppy.  Our one male is neutered.  All of our dogs are well-behaved and very calm.

1256,Primary,23450,0,,3W11,Wind,16306,05/26/11,"As a student, my daily schedule tends to vary depending on my class schedule. Some days I have class for up to 4 hours whereas others I may only have 2 hours of class. My weekend schedule varies, and sometimes I go out of town to visit my boyfriend or my family, both of which are places the puppy can come along with me. Starting in the fall, I will begin seeing patients at my school's clinic as well as doing an externship at an assisted living in washington, DC. Whether or not the puppy can attend these two activities with me is still unsure. Either way, I have the flexibility to come home every few hours since I live locally to school and my externship. The most important thing to know about my lifestyle is that I live in an apartment building. A patient (and QUIET) puppy will be best for me (if possible!) since I will have to travel a little farther out of my building for the pup to get busy. My only major life change will be that my schedule is going to shift in the fall (as I mentioned with patients and my externship). I will be going on two separate vacations this summer that I may need to send the puppy on a puppy sit (dates are still not definite). I leave to go home to NJ over major holidays and around Christmas for a couple of weeks, but the dog will be able to come with me at that time (I just won't be able to attend classes at that time)."

We have an unneutered male great dane living next door who can come in our yard so it might be wise to go with a male puppy, though I would be happy to have a male or female. I am not currently employed so my daily schedule is flexible and changes day to day.   I come and go frequently, but I do not need to leave a puppy for long periods of time. We live in the town of Vienna where there are sidewalks in all the neighborhoods, and lots of people and other dogs walk frequently past our house.  My husband and I are usually around on the week-ends and take lots of hikes in the woods and  walks in our neighborhood.  We are both active and like to be outdoors as much as possible. We have no children at home anymore. I have lots of experience with dogs and I can appreciate how good the training techniques are that GEB is teaching us. I believe that positive reinforcement is the only way to teach a dog, since they always want to please their owner more than anything."

We have a 14 year old yellow lab who has recently slowed down a lot.  We like walks and live in a normal suburbs.  The puppy will be exposed to many children 12 and under regularly.

We have never had a family pet before.  3 children living at home  Jessica will be 20 in October.  She had a true dog phobia as a child and has worked hard to break herself of that ""embarrasing"" condition.  Still not   100% but Jodi is working with her and she's been to every class so far and is excited to be participating.  Oliver will be 13 this summer.  Oliver describes himself as an indoor person and was turned off by the smell of the treats and slime on his hands at the last training session, his first intro to treating!  he had to wash his hands half way thru the session.  He is very excited about being a trainer however and he and his brother have been begging for years for a dog.  He is very smart and is well aware of the commitment and the requirements - lots of going outside - and is still willing to be a part.  John will be 11 this summer.  A little nervous around bigger dogs ever since he recieved a long red scratch that broke the skin down the entire length of his back when a friends large dog jumped up on him to greet him about a year ago.  He is very excited about participating and is a real outdoor boy.    We are very active in our church, which is half an hour from our home.  Sunday morning we leave the house before 9 and can return by 12:30ish but twice a month we go out for lunch afterwards, every other month we have a fellowship meal at the church building  followed by a meeting for committees that Jose and I are part of (Jose is a deacon and has more meetings than I do.)  We will probably be able to bring the puppy to the building with us most times when we need to.  Jesica doesn't go with us very often becasue she works on Sundays (Kohl's) so she may be able to take care of the puppy depending on her schedule (sometimes she goes in at 9 on sundays, sometimes 12.)  We go home, Jose and I take a nap and the boys finish up any homeowrk then it's back to church again in the evening leaving about 5 and returning about 8.  I teach John's class on sunday nights and can have the puppy in class with me.    Monday thru Thursday I am home most of the day, usually doing all my errands on monday.  Oliver and John usually have after school sports and clubs after school Monday thru thursdays.  Fridays this year were arranged visits with a friend for John, so every other weekend he had a friend over for an hour after school.  Saturdays the boys often spend in their pajamas!  Or we go somewhere, festival or something.    We live in a townhouse."

However, I do attend Middletown High's Agricultural Program and  I have recieved permission to bring the puppy to school with with me and walk him,and spend time with him during my study halls,and agricultural classes.

The girls are off to bed between 8 and 9pm. We end our day by 10pm. Both Emma and Sydney are very insightful and interested in dogs. One concern that we have is that Sydney is  very fast moving and at times lacks impulse control.    In the summer we like to vacation at the beach in New Jersey.

On the weekend  we are typically having or attending some kind of family/friend gathering and or attending our sons baseball games. Occasionally we will road trip to see our sons at their various schools but since the end of the school year is here the soonest that would happen would be typically the end of September or in October.  We usually take a family summer driving vacation so puppy would be able to join us.  The only inflexible time when we will not be able to have the puppy with us is when we fly out of town the day after Christmas for a yearly family vacation.

I intend on integrating the puppy into the college atmosphere as soon as possible.  My classes are from 10:45 AM - 4PM, which consists of three classes and I do have time to run home and let him get busy, play and feed him between.  The rest of the week I usually get up around 7:30 and I'm not working right now so I have plenty of time to raise and educate the puppy.  I usually go to bed around 11PM but have had puppies in the past and willing to get up in the middle of the night with him.  My children are grown and live out-of-state, so I live by myself, however, do have an emergency back up to let the puppy  ""Get Busy"" if needed, with a quick phone call. I really don't have any health, physical restrictions or ailments to speak of, pretty healthy!"
1389,Primary,22802,0,,5R410,Rhyme,16083,01/19/11,"We are a family with an active lifestyle.  Jerry (father/husband) works in Manhattan and travels for work throughout the year.  Kathleen (mother/wife) is a stay at home mom and therefore will be the main puppy raiser.  Megan (10) and Kylie (7) are active children that are excited to work with a pup.  We had a Lab for 13 years that was an integral part of our family.  Both of the girl's first words where his name, Jack.  We live on a private lane in Westport.  There are many children and dogs in the neighborhood -- but no sidewalks.  The family spends most of our time on the first floor of our private house.  The bedrooms are all upstairs.  A typical weekday is hectic in the morning with Jerry leaving before anyone else is awake.  Kathleen gets up with the children and gets them to school.  About once a week this entails a 7:30 carpool with 4 other children.  Ideally we will then walk to the bus by 8:10 (we drive if later).  Kathleen spends 3 mornings a week visiting Jerry's mother.  She has moderate Altzeihmer's and lives in Brookdale, and assisted living facility about 10 minutes away.  Kathleen plans to take the pup to Brookdale whenever possilbe.  Mrs. Doyle is a lifelong Lab lover and looks forward to interacting with the pup.    The later part of the morning/early afternoon would be dedicated to the pup and household chores & errands.  The girls are picked up from school at 3:15 and usually have activities right afterschool.  Mondays we have 3 additional girls come over before carpooling -- so it can be a bustling household.  Every Thursday afterschool, Kathleen leads a girl scout troop (she is a leader for both a 2nd & 5th grade troop at school).   After activities Kathleen cooks dinner while the girls complete their homework.  After dinner the girls often dance/jump around the house before bath & bedtime.  They are asleep by 8:30.  Kathleen & Jerry are up until about 11pm.  Weekends in our family vary.  We go to our home in Ludlow, VT (about 3 1/2 hours away) at least once a month (we sometimes stay for up to a week during the summer).  We have a small, 2-story private house on a residential street in town.  There are sidewalks, and weather permitting, we walk into town every morning.  We often ski, but usually only for a half day.  We will be flexible based on the pup's needs.  We look forward to taking the pup on hikes in the summer (on a leash of course!).    Our weekends in CT are filled with social and sport activities (spring soccer, summer swimming).  We often entertain -- both adults & children.  Every other month or so we visit family in Eastern Long Island.  We've already discussed bringing the pup with us.    We are all very excited to raise a pup and look forward to spending lots of time trainging the pup and exposing him/her to lot's of varied activities and environments!"
1409,Primary,22799,0,,6R410,Rochelle,16084,01/13/11,"A typical week for me looks like this:  Monday through Friday ‚Äì Wake at 4:45 A.M. to feed, change water, clean litter box and play with our five indoor cats and then to feed and water the chickens.  This takes until 5:00 or 5:30.  In this time span I used to feed and water and let Jake out to ‚Äúget busy‚Äù before and after eating (Jake was my husband‚Äôs retired GEB dog who recently passed away.)  5:30 ‚Äì 6:00 ‚Äì spare time to watch the news, play with the cats, pack lunch, etc.    6:00 ‚Äì 6:45 ‚Äì get ready for work and head out.  This takes a little longer in the winter due to needing to warm up the truck and remove snow if necessary.  If you need to know for travel purposes with the puppy, I drive a two seater pick-up truck so the puppy will be trained to sit on the floor of the passenger side like Paul‚Äôs two GEB dogs were trained to do.  6:45 ‚Äì 7:45 ‚Äì Drive to Columbus to the Ohio State School for the Blind where I work as an O&M specialist.  I have already gotten approval from the school administration to bring the puppy to work with me on a daily basis.  8:00 ‚Äì 8:53 ‚Äì Prep period in office (My office is a quiet place with little traffic, I have an office mate who is fine with me bringing the puppy into the office) ‚Äì this time is usually spent lesson planning, report writing, talking with other teachers about students or getting ready for the day.  It is a ‚ÄúFree time‚Äù to get done what needs to be done for the day.    9:00 ‚Äì 11:45 ‚Äì The morning of my day is broken up into 4 lesson times for O&M.  The lesson times vary from 42 minutes long (1 class period) to 84 minutes long (2 class periods back to back). When I am out of my office for lessons, my office mate is out on her own lessons as well and the office will be empty.  The puppy will not be going on lessons with me due to the distraction factor for my students and because this will be a good time for the puppy to sleep.  11:45 ‚Äì 12:20 ‚Äì During this time I am doing lunch duty in while the students eat.  12:20 ‚Äì 1:07 ‚Äì My lunch time.  I am usually done eating in 10 minutes, so the rest of this time is free.  1:07 ‚Äì 2:30 ‚Äì This time is 2 - 42 minute long  lessons or 1 ‚Äì 84 minute long lesson with a student at which time the puppy will remain in my office.  3:15 ‚Äì 4:00 ‚Äì Wrap up the day.  4:00 ‚Äì 5:00 ‚Äì Drive time (or when I have my puppy, I will use this opportunity to go for an afternoon walk before heading home because I will have access to sidewalks, etc.)  Due to having so many animals, at least once a week there is a trip to the pet store for supplies before jumping on the freeway for home.  About one other time during the week there is usually another errand that needs to be run.  And Thursdays I will be driving straight from work to puppy class in Berea.  When I arrive home, the first thing I do is take care of the cats, chickens and make dinner.  The rest of the evening is spent doing household chores or filling empty time.  10:00 ‚Äì 11:00 ‚Äì Bedtime  Saturdays and Sundays ‚ÄìI use this time usually to grocery shop if need be or run other errands.  It is pretty flexible.  An important note:  Paul (my husband) is away at school at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, MI.  He is getting his Master‚Äôs in Vision Rehabilitation Therapy.  I travel up there to see him 2 times a month.  It is a 5 hour drive one way.  The typical trip is a Saturday morning into a Sunday afternoon.  Paul lives in an apartment on campus and his resident advisor is fine with him having me as a visitor with a GEB puppy.  This will only be until mid-May.  At this time in May, Paul will be moving back home to Fredericktown to start his internship in Columbus.   Our lifestyle is pretty quiet and laid back.  Neither Paul nor I are excitable people, but we like to make the most out of life and have fun.  We have a fenced in yard and a house that comfortably fits 5 cats, my husband and I and a puppy/dog.  We like routine and predictability but are very flexible with the interruptions that can happen at any given day.  We are very grounded people.  I understand, firsthand, what this puppy will one day mean to a person who is blind.  Whereas I have had dogs all of my life (golden retrievers as a kid and my husbands‚Äô two GEB labs) it has been a LONG time since I have had a puppy.  This puppy will be intergrated into every part of my life, from a full work day to evening free time to traveling to Kalamazoo every other weekend for the next 4 months to visit Paul.  I have a huge support group behind me, my husband, my family and my workplace.  The only thing my work place administration is worried about is barking (so a less vocal pup is a request of mine).  If it were a perfect world then I would be matched with a black lab boy puppy who is laid back and has a soft soul, but that is in the spirit of our dear Jake who we miss so much.  Any dog you match me with I will raise with the utmost love and respect and guidance so that this exceptional animal‚Äôs future career goal is met with success."

I go to gym.  11:00-Get busy. Feed Pup. Get Busy.  The remainder of the day is generally open and my schedule is flexible.

The oldest is 23 and lives and works in Baltimore.  The youngest is 20 and is a Junior in college.  He will be home for vacations and for the summer.  He is enthusiastic and supportive of this opportunity.  He loves animals, especially dogs, and is fully aware that there are critical skills and socialization ""rules"" for us to follow.

I very much enjoy that, but understand that my volunteering may be impacted by the time I need to devote to puppy raising. Maybe there's a balance that will work for all concerned. When I'm not at the CDC, I'm usually up around 7AM, breakfast and emails until around 9AM. I then usually exercise (biking or ice hockey depending on the season) until mid-day, with chores, house maintenance, shopping, reading taking up a good part of the afternoon.

1479,Primary,22604,0,,2C410,Cameron,15984,10/28/10,"I am currently a graduate student seeking my master's degree in social work at UAlbany, and have a part-time job. For me, this means that I am in class 12 hours a week (3 four-hour classes: 2 on Monday 9-12 and 1-4 and one Thurs 1-4) and intern at Albany Medical Center for 8 hours a day, two days a week. On the days I am interning, I do get an hour break for lunch and could easily come home to let the dog out during this time. As for work, I work Monday nights from 5:30-8PM, but just about all other times I am at home or running an occasional errand. Fortunately, though, I will have some support raising this dog. My boyfriend and his roommate will also be helping me and attending classes. The puppy will be living mostly at their apartment which is the entire second floor of a house and has a small non-enclosed backyard. Sometimes, though, the puppy will be at my house when the boys are not home or have gone somewhere over night. My apartment is a block away from their's and is the second and third floor of a house. I have two roommates who are aware of my decision to raise a puppy and are on board to learn how to help me teach him good house manners and adhere to Guiding Eye training policies. Our landlords and the other tenants living below me and my boyfriend's apartments are also close friends and aware with and fine with us raising a puppy in our apartments. Both of our apartments are in Albany, and we do both have neighboring houses very close to the vicinity of ours. On some weekends, (about once every 6 weeks), we travel home to Long Island and have considered how this might affect us being able to raise a puppy. We have thought about and worked out a plan (according to the advice we have received from Guiding Eyes) to transport the puppy when we do this and for a place for the puppy to stay when we get there. My parents have agreed to let the puppy stay at my house while we are home and are excited to also take part in teaching him good house manners and socialization. While at my house on Long Island, I have a large enclosed yard which I hope to utilize to let the puppy have some free space to run and get active. My family does have another dog at home, however, this dog is a Shiba Inu and has been exposed to a number of other dogs coming to my house (cousin's dogs) without their ever being a problem. Our Shiba Inu always has to stay on a leash when outside due to their hunting nature and tendency to run. As for other weekends, when we are not traveling home. My boyfriend and I are pretty much always at his apartment or not very far. Our weekends are pretty low-key at this point and provide us with ample time to socialize the dog and get out to new places and settings. Finally, as far as upcoming events, we plan on traveling home to Long Island for our winter break which will be about 4 weeks in December. We have discussed with our RM possibly attending classes at the Guiding Eyes Center in NYC at this time, if this can be arranged, so that we do not miss out on classes. We would be more than willing to travel there to attend classes and are hoping this will work. If not though, we will work on arranging something to get back to the area for the nights that classes are held, or at least the majority of them (we may have to miss just one if that is the case). Other than that, we do plan on graduating in May and leaving the area to return home to Long Island. This may leave us only able to raise a puppy until May, however, depending on how things go and how much time we find needed to raise the puppy and what kind of  feasible plan we are able to work out, we are considering the possibility of also keeping the puppy after May and transferring to the NYC Guiding Eyes Center, as we recently have been told we may be able to do.     We are, with the support of our roommates and families, excited to raise a puppy for Guiding Eyes! If you need any further information about our situation or I was unclear about anything, PLEASE let us know! Thank you so much for this opportunity!"

Our typical weekday schedule has us waking up at 6:00 (my husband will take the pup out to get busy while I shower), me dropping off kids at school at 8:00 (we can walk there with the pup), and me leaving for work at 9:00.  I can return  home from 12:30-1:30 to take the pup out to get busy and get some exercise, and then my husband comes home from work at 4:30, at which time he'll take the pup out to get busy and then walk the pup to pick the kids up at school.  I get home from work at 6:00 and we can be focused on the pup from 6:00-10:00 for training, exercise, fun time and relax time before bed.  On days we work from home, the schedule will be the same in the mornings up to 9:00, and rather than crate the pup from 9:00-12:30 and 1:30-4:30, we will have him with us while we work.  On weekends, our schedules are very open and flexible, and we can dedicate all our time to the pup, planning experiences for training and fun, and working him into our own activities and errands.  I've developed a spreadsheet with some example daily schedules to show how the pup can be incorporated into our lives."

The lack of demands on me is wonderful. I don't know that I'm retired, but right now I'm not working. So, I'm very flexible and available to the puppy. I am very active and healthy, and walk my current dog 3 X/day, probably 2 miles. He doesn't know about back yards, and is used to being walked. I like the exercise too. He is 8, and super beta. Very very sweet. I have a 10 year old, large male cat, who is very alpha. I tried Brook Farm vet this week for a bath for Tony (my dog), and between that experience and their incessant surveying/reminders/etc., I need to try another vet. Roosevelt Vets were recommended by my neighbors, but I haven't checked them out yet. I don't know the policy for puppies. I had a brood dog for 3 months, and then all vet care was provided by Guiding Eyes. I don't know what the case is for puppies.

I work in marketing for IBM and generally work remotely.    Our day begins around 8pm when Kieran gets up.  Lakshmi is normally gone to work at the hospital by this time so I get Kieran ready for the day (changing him, using the bathroom, getting dressed, and preparing breakfast).  Kieran knows a puppy is coming to live with us in January and is very excited to help with the training.  Kieran is very active and talkative and will need to be trained on how to approach the puppy (as well as vice-versa!)  Kieran‚Äôs nanny comes at 9am and stays until 7pm, at which point Lakshmi is home from work.    During the week, I tend to work from a few different places.  I often start working at home and sometimes work from home all day!  Other days I go to an office in midtown near Bryant Park.  I am now driving to Westchester once a week to work in an office there but I expect that to be over by February or March at the latest.  The puppy is welcome at all these work places regardless.    During the day I normally go to the gym or for a run for an hour and the puppy would be left at home in the crate, until the pup is old enough to join me for sustained outdoor exercise.    In the evenings I tend to be out and about doing a variety of different things ‚Äì playing on a sports team, meeting a friend for a coffee or drink or dinner, going to lectures or meetups on topics I‚Äôm interested in, and other social activities.  I‚Äôm planning on integrating the puppy as much as possible into these activities.  I also hope that since I will be spending the day with the puppy that the pup will enjoy taking naps in the crate in the early evenings.  Overall though, I understand the pup is my first priority and I don‚Äôt have any activities that simply can‚Äôt be skipped.    I will also take the dog to visit my parents in Yonkers, where they have an enclosed yard perfect for playing and training.  They have three miniature schanzuers who are on the wild side.  It will definitely be good training on how to deal with less well-behaved dogs!  I have lots of friends in my UES neighborhood and in the building who have dogs.  They have all offered to have the pup over and introduce him to their pets.  We also have an enclosed playground outside the building where the dogs can play in a safe space.    I also enjoy traveling and plan on taking the puppy with me.  Normally I tend to travel abroad but while I‚Äôm raising the puppy I hope to learn more about places that are closer to home!  The pup will come with me in the car and we already have a one or two week trip planned to North Carolina via Washington, DC in late April.  My friends are looking forward to meeting the pup and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be a good experience for everyone."

As the puppy gets older, additional socialization outside the home will be worked in as well, including longer, different walks, exposure to neighborhood children, other dogs, and animals such as ducks, squirrels, rabbits, etc.  Becoming a Puppy Raiser will essentially become my new full time occupation because it is something we feel so strongly about!

I scheduled 930 AM classes so that I will have time to tend to my puppy in the morning, and then 2:00 and 3:30 classes so I have time for lunch and play time. When I am not at class I am on the executive board of the largest social group on Campus called Campus Ministry. We every last Sunday and first Monday of the month for meetings in addition to any extra fundraissing events we do on campus for local food shelters or homeless shelters. I have received the approval of my campus to allow my dog to come with me to classes and anywhere else I may need to get to (pending the pup is ready for those experiences and what the Guiding Eyes deems as acceptable places for him to be).

I will be in touch with my future teachers over break to see which ones would be willing to have the dog in their classroom during class. Otherwise, the dog will be in the crate for my classes or with Amanda Werbeck or Alex Wallistch. I have breaks in between my classes so I can come let the dog out and be with it so it is not just stuck in the crate all day. My schedule is going to be pretty flexible.

Have my coffee while sitting on the couch reading, then meditating till about 8AM    Take an exercise walk for about 30 minutes.    Shower    Start working around 9:30-ish: that means checking and responding to emails, returning phone calls, setting up appointments.    I generally see 4 to 5 clients a day for hypnosis, healing work, or intuitive readings. At least one of these is a phone session, so there are on average 4 new people coming into my home for about 1 hour each. These appointments can be at any time during the day: I don't have regular set hours. The earliest appointment I ever have is 10AM, and the latest one I'll do is 6PM.    A couple evenings/month I go out from about 7-8:30 for Message Circles, the Library Board meetings, or to dinner with my sweetheart.    3-4 nights/week I stay at his house (so the pup would come with me). He lives about 4 miles away from me. This doesn't effect my wake-up schedule. I still get up at the same time, just drive back to my house for coffee, etc.    I usually eat dinner around 6PM, but it could be later if I have a client scheduled at that time.    Most evenings I read or watch TV until about 10PM, when I go to bed.    I have a VERY stress-free lifestyle, live alone, and very much enjoy what I do. That means my home is very serene, I'm almost always feeling very joyful, and just love helping people. On my walks I engage with many of my neighbors, on weekends I work around my house or in my yard, and would absolutely LOVE to have a little puppy to raise in this wonderful atmosphere.    That's my typical day. Some days I have no clients scheduled and spend my time writing or working on marketing materials or on my website. Life is good!"

I expect to meet puppy's needs through what I anticipate will be a fascinating educational experience for me and puppy as we work to negotiate together this new and challenging undertaking. There is little doubt that we will learn from each other and both be better for it always keeping in mind the ultimate goal of providing increased independence for one in need of assistance. I am looking forward to meeting my puppy and getting to know better my fellow raisers and GEB professionals. I will do my best to keep puppy healthy, safe, focused and loved and will draw, whenever necessary, from those that have been there before me. Thanks for this opportunity."
1667,Primary,21959,0,,1R10,Rawlins,15559,04/23/10,"My typical day prior to becoming a puppy raiser consists of getting up in the morning, preparing myself for work and walking the eighth mile to work. I have a 1 hour lunch break, which I spend at home and am finished with work at 5. I return home after that time and run any errands (usually on foot) or participate in martial arts classes.   Once I have become a puppy raiser, I plan to rise at least an hour earlier to let the dog eliminate and then go on a long morning walk. My friend Lauren will also walk the dog  after I have gone to work and practice training exercises before my lunch break. During lunch the dog will be out of the crate again. After work, I plan to bring the dog on most errands (particularly once we have established basic behaviors). I live alone and intend training to be a constant and consistent endeavor. Once the dog can effectively Settle, I plan (and have received permission to) bring the dog to the office with me, for gradually increased amounts of time. Burlington is generally a dog-friendly city where the pup will undoubtedly be exposed to numerous other dogs, people, noises, surfaces and fast moving objects. I also happen to live in a part of the city in which many refugees are settled and a number of elementary schools are located. This will give the dog the opportunity to experience people from numerous nationalities as well as small children. Lauren works with children and hopes to bring the dog on visits to her after school program once the pup is ready to handle that amount of stimulation. I am open and eager to work with the Regional Manager to establish a relationship which allows for open communication and constructive feedback. I am looking forward to the opportunity to be involved in the mission of this organization and the chance to train a puppy with a purpose."

I have taken her for obedience training at Canine Kindergarten, and we are presently taking an advanced obedience class there  Nora has spent time at daycare at Canine Kindergarten and loves to play with other dogs.   Although she is not up to GEB standards, she is a terrific companion, smart, and lots of fun for both my husband an me.    I volunteered to play with the IFT dogs at Yorktown a few years ago.  It was fun, and I was really impressed with the dogs there.    In my former life I was an executive with a privately owned chemical company.  Prior to that I taught economics and finance at SUNY New Paltz.    We live in the woods,  Our house is single story and no fence (we have the invisible fence for Nora).  Our floors are waxed concrete, so they are slippery, but easy to clean.    Our children live close by, and we spend time with those two families.  The kids are used to Nora, so I am sure they and also enjoy a new pup.    I am physically active,  Nora and, hopefully a new pup, would help with that.    Lastly, I love dogs and have had a wonderful life so far.  It is time to ""give back""..and raising a pup for a blind person is something I think I can do well."

I have 3 other roommates in a 3 bedroom house with a small back yard.  I work full time at an animal hospital in Irondequoit where I plan on taking the puppy with me to work once he is fully vaccinated.  I spend my nights after work relaxing at home or hanging out with friends on occasion.  My boyfriend lives with me and will be helping me out a little bit but I will be the main puppy raiser. A typical day for me is waking up to go to work by 8AM and coming home around 5PM.  There are days when I go in around 11AM and get home around 8PM. I like to live an active lifestyle and although I may to make some adjustments to my daily routine I am more than willing to do so .  I am very excited to raise another puppy!

During the week, I usually have to go to the doctors, Target and weekly classes with my kids, so the pup goes with us.  If at our doctors, the pup comes in - they all know us and what we are doing with GEB.  At stores,  we work on settleing outside and the different environments.

I have a 21 year old daughter who comes home from college during the summer and has helped with a previous puppy.

Once the other GEB puppies that we have had have been housebroken, we have started to take them to these events so that they have learned to settle quietly for long periods of time. Most of my days are relatively unstructured. My husband works 4 10 hour days/ week. We have 4 other families that we get together with every month with children ranging from 8 years up to adulthood.

Both are trained and have good house manners.  Both received their AKC Canine Good Citizenship certificates.   I believe our family would be best suited with a male Labrador .   Having a female in heat would not bring 'calm and peace' in my household (even though Yankee is neutered).

We (Belle&I) start the day w/ walking the neighborhood for at LEAST 1/2 hr when it's not too cold. We are really active.    I work mostly from home, when need to I go to office. I have flexible schedule. I am mostly on the phone for meeting in the morning. I tried to get Belle exercise and tired out so she just relax most morning while I attend my meetings.  We walk again at lunch time 30-40mins. When Rugby, neighbor dog, is out Belle plays w/ Rugby for 15 mins.    Belle comes w/ us mostly when I will only drop or pick up Soney.

1398,Primary,18780,0,,4N410,Namath,16065,01/15/11,"I live in a small brownstone building on Manhattan's Upper West Side.  It is a co-op and I am the Treasurer of the Board of the Corporation which, in my building, means I do everything from paying the bills to escorting the exterminator around the building every month, to scheduling inspections and repairs of the boiler and elevator and. . . . well, you name it and in my building the Treasurer does it all!    My husband, Michael, will be raising the puppy with me.  Our neighbors, especially a teenage boy upstairs, all support our raising of a GEB puppy and help with the process.  We have five adult children between the two of us, none of whom live with us but we do visit each other when we can and the ""kids"" always love playing with whatever puppy we happen to have.  The actual raising of the dog, however, will be done by us.   Our apartment is on two floors and has an internal spiral staircase so early  on our puppy will learn how to walk up and down those stairs.   We have a large terrace which is a great space for grooming and playing as well. Michael has a full-time (9 - 5 )job whereas I teach flute lessons outside our home around 8 hours/week.  My teaching hours are flexible so clearly I am at home during the day more than Michael is.  I have rehearsals one evening most weeks and Michael will be taking classes at NYU two evenings/week.  We are planning to cover for each other during those times.  My day typically revolves around straightening up the house (laundry, dishwasher, making the bed), checking never-ending e-mail, dealing with endless co-op business (I am the Treasurer, remember?), my teaching schedule, practicing, rehearsals (and performances) and my commitment to going to my local YMCA for an hour's exercise every weekday.  I raised one other GEB dog and found it extremely useful to take him with me everywhere I could: the bank, Eileen Fisher (they love dogs there), the Gap, Gracious Homes, the Post Office, the subway, buses - basically everyplace except places that serve or sell food.  However, we even found an outdoor restaurant in Cold Spring, NY where we could take him right to the table with us.  Both of us will make a point to take the pup with us wherever we go.  We live near both Central Park and Riverside Park and anticipate many walks with puppy there as well.    Finally, we have a home in the Poconos, Pa which provides an entirely different experience for our puppy.  We have found that all dogs (we have sat a few in addition to raising Saxon) love to explore a new, much larger house and - the best of all - learning to swim in the lake that is about 100' or so from the back of the house.  Also, it gives us a chance to take the dog on a ride in the car (1 1/2 to 2 hours), something we city-folk don't tend to do as much as our suburban counterparts.    We understand the challenges of incorporating the care of a young puppy into our lives that are already busy with work, family and housekeeping commitments, but we both love dogs (we both grew up with dogs as pets) and look forward to integrating our new, very special, puppy into our lives.  As for me, I find it nothing short of an honor and privilege to be part of the process that will enable a dog to open the world to a visually impaired person.  Ever since I was in seventh grade, I was fascinated with ""Seeing Eye Dogs"" and seriously considered a career working with Seeing Eye in Morristown, NJ.  Now, several years (only several :-)) and several careers later, I am not surprised to find myself still fascinated by the intelligence and almost magical ability of guide dogs to perform their jobs.  I am grateful to enjoy my life as it is right now:  with my new husband, teaching & playing music, managing my small apartment building in NYC, and raising a dog for GEB.  I will do the best I can to enable our next GEB puppy to be the best guide dog he can be."

We also raised Manny who passed his IFT but was released while in training. We adopted him on 11/10/2011. He will be 4 yrs old in June. He is now a therapy dog and I will be taking him to regular visits that are usually no longer than 1 hour.   I work part time (usually 1 day/week) at ""Central Hospital for Veterinary Medicine"" (4 Devine St, North Haven, CT 06473) as a Tech Assistant. I have spoken with my supervisor and she said I could put a crate in the Dr's office where there is no contact with sick patients, although there might be occasionally a Dr's pet in that room. I will request not to take care of contagious patients while the puppy is at work with me. I always change out of my scrubs before coming home after work. I just found out that another puppy raiser from our region is interested in puppysitting our new pup on the days I'll be working! So I won't need to bring the pup to work after all! When the puppy is old enough to stay in the crate for several hours, I will leave the puppy home and my husband will take the puppy and Manny out once while I'm at work (he already does this for Manny now).   I volunteer at the Middle School Library 2 mornings/ week and at the Food Pantry on Sat mornings and babysit for our church's Moms' group one morning/week. I am also very involved with my church and participate in several weekly groups. I will put any of my activities on hold until the puppy is able to be in the crate for longer periods or as the puppy gets used to new exposures, I hope to include the pup in my activities with me.   We live in a house with a fairly large back yard which is not fenced in. We let Manny out on a long (50ft) leash and play with him there.   Manny and I walk to a friend's house (where there is a fenced-in back yard) several mornings/ week and another friend and her dog join us there too. The 3 dogs play for a while then Manny and I walk home;It's about 1 mile each way. I am hoping to bring the new pup with us on these outings. Of course he/she won't be able to walk the mile each way at the beginning, so we'll need to drive. Bur as the pup gets older I'm hoping to do this.   Our neighborhood is quiet, but there are quite busy streets very close by. My husband and Manny and I like to  take long walks every day and part of the walk is along the busy street, so Manny is very used to traffic. We would be including the new pup on the walks as he/she is able.   Our older son will be getting married out of State in June, so we will be needing a puppysitter for a few weeks then.  We usually drive out to Chicago once or twice/ year to visit family. We have in the past brought the GEB pups we were raising with us on these trips and hope to do this again with the new pup.  Manny loves other dogs and is very gentle and submissive. He would be a great ""big brother"" to a little pup, I think. Hopefully he will only teach his good manners :)!"

He will then have his meal and socialization time. I would walk him and then head to school around 10 (first period is a free block) at which point one of my parents is typically home. I return from school at 3:30, having allowed the puppy to have some crate time while I was gone so that my return would equal a walk a play, and taking him out to the nearest town where sidewalks, people, and distracts are present. I am very active, I love going out for hikes and being outdoors, as well as interacting with friends. We have an older dog, so a wild puppy would not be great, but one who would be able to go to soccer and football games with me and be okay walking in the woods and meeting new people. My weekends are always unscheduled so they are the most flexible. A male puppy is definitely preferred, and a yellow lab would also great based on past experience with the differing mannerisms.  I will be going to college next fall, so my mom and I are going to be sharing responsibility so that he will respond to her when I leave in 12 months."

I do, once a week, occasionally more, occasionally less work at CT US&R headquarters in Hartford.  We have US&R dogs on our team.  Also some of the State Troopers have offices in the building and they have GEB trained dogs. The puppy will be warmly welcomed at the office.  I have a large, secure indoor train/play space available for the puppy and me.  Also a crate will be on site next to my desk for the puppy.  During the week we live in a condo with safe, quiet streets.  We live in a ""cluster"" with neighbors very close.  We have a golden retriever and maltese adult dogs in the cluster, and many dogs in the condo complex. We also have a fenced in tennis court where the puppy and I can train/play (after the snow melts).  On the weekends we live in a house with stairs.  The dead end road is quiet and we have woods with trails next to the property.  This switching of residences will end in mid-June when we will permanently leave the condo.    Mitch-Will do the early, early morning walks and the last walk in the evening. He will have a 1.5 hour weekday, daily commute. He will work at home one day during the week (we're thinking Tuesday).  His office hours are 10 am-6 pm. His weekend schedule is flexible.  The puppy is welcome to be with Mitch at the office.  The company is very understanding and supportive and will allow Mitch the time he needs to tend to the puppy's needs.    Kyle-High School senior.  Has the least flexible schedule.  Kyle attends high school from 7:10 am -2:05 pm.  He works after school at IBM until 5 pm-ish.  If, need be, Kyle can be home with the puppy after school until 3 pm. Kyle is also taking a 4 hour college course on Tuesday nights which unfortunately is a direct conflict with the GEB class.  On Tuesdays, Kyle does not work and is home from 2:30 pm to 5:00 pm.  In August Kyle will be leaving to attend Syracuse University."
37,Primary,12952,0,Southern CT,8E315,Eliza,20344,11/11/15,"I have a very flexible schedule and only have to be on campus for work on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. I have meetings on Fridays once or twice a month.    On Tuesdays and Thursdays I leave the house by 7, so those mornings the pup will get a quick walk and fed but not much  training in the morning. Once I get to campus there will be many opportunities for quick lessons and fun. My office is in a very quiet part of campus. It lends itself well to the STEP techniques. Slowly I will be able to introduce the pup to more and more situations. I teach in 90 minute blocks and during those periods the pup will need to be in the crate. Tuesday is my late night, we don't get home until 7:30. On Thursdays we're home by 4:30 and Wednesdays are 11 to 3. I think my situation is particularly conducive to working with the puppy. I can get up and take him out and do short lessons all day long. But, my one concern is that when I'm with students or in class that the puppy be happily settled in his crate. It would not be a good fit for me to have a pup who cried and barked in the crate.     On the weekend I often go to the Cape (well, after the 12 weeks of puppy classes) to take care of my income property. It will usually be my dog Gulliver, the pup, and me. We will have plenty of time and will do lessons and have fun, but I will also need to get some painting done.    I have a small house that sometimes has some of my adult children in residence. I have a small fenced in yard. I live in a neighborhood with sidewalks that have texture at the crosswalks and crosswalks that talk. There is a post office, lots of restaurants, and a pharmacy. Many places to become socialized.    I am a runner and would like to know if/when the pup can come running with me and what distances s/he can run."

The pup will be allowed to come to the E Clinic until he is old enough to be left in a crate for 6 hours.  Since I am fortunate enough to bring my pups to work with me, I need a pup that is low key & not be too demanding so I am not too distracted from my job.  I live alone so I would not be able to raise a pup without bringing him to work with me.  Bringing the pups to work offers them a lot of exposures on a regular basis."

My typical day is free to do what I want and when the pup arrives I will be planning most of my days around pup;she will be socialized well.  Jack and I travel frequently and plan on taking the pup on trips with us.  I enjoy a quiet pup because I can connect easily with her (ideally I would like a pup like Maple - so sweet and gentle with people and appropriately assertive with other dogs).  We live in a large house with 3 acres of land on a quiet road which forms a 1 mile circle.  We are planning on putting up a temporary fence enabling the pup to run around.  Our house is very quiet, except when the grandchildren are visiting.  Our grandchildren are are Payton, 5 years old, and Adalyn, 2 years old.  We visit them often in NH.  We will be getting a new grandchild in the middle of June.  Sometime in June or July, I will need to go to Houston to help out and may stay  up to 4 weeks (probably a lot less) accordingly to how badly I am needed.  The plans for this travel and the time I will be needed have not been finalized yet.  I love GEB, I love the instructors and the other raisers and most of all - I love the pup.  I have been known to take time off between pups and have been pup-sitting a lot since Maple went for her IFT - Nanette, Lani, Juliann, Harriet, and have had pup sleepovers frequently: Farley, Lolly.  What I've learned from these experiences is that all pups are different and all, every one of them, are so very special with lots of love to give."

I am the Doggie Daycare Director (as well as Receptionist, Bather & Kennel Attendant)  I live on a 10-acre ""farm"" that my boyfriend (of 7 years) and I rent from my mother.  My sister (who is a Vet Tech) lives in an ""in-law"" type apartment attached to our home and shares a kitchen & dining room w/ us as well as the basement for laundry etc.  Our ""farm"" is home to 4 horses, 16 ducks, 4 barn cats, 4 home dogs (1 GSD, 3 yr old spayed female - released GEB pup, 1 Lab, 8 yr old neutered male - GEB retired guide, 1 Border Collie, 4 yr old neutered male & 1 American Eskimo, 9 year old spayed female), 4 house cats & 1 house rabbit.

We spend as much time with my boyfriends family as possible... they are the type of people that throw a party for any occassion.  Our GEB pups are always welcome at these events.       Our ""lifestyle"" is on a day by day basis. I tend to work during the day, my boyfriend works at night so there's almost always someone home taking care of things.   Each of our dogs goes to work with me so they are all very well socialized, both with people and other dogs.  GEB pups have the opportunity to socialize with other dogs and become familiar with the kennel environment.      ""In my free time"" I train & compete in dog agility with my GSD & Border Collie.

We enjoyed being part of GEB for several years and now that our daughter is schoolage feel we have the time to committ back to volunteering. Oh, and our labs are age 11 1/2 years and 14 1/2. Both are still quite active - playful - and are walked daily - I think they both would accept a new pup in the home without any challenge. Only other random thought...though I have been partial to female dogs in the past, I am kind of curious if a male dog may be a good fit for us (for really not good reason).

445,Primary,8293,0,Southern CT,4R413,Rowena,18853,03/09/14,"We are both semi-retired, but have a very active lifestyle. One of us is home most of the time and would never leave the puppy for more than 3 hours in a crate, and that would be very unusual.  We have 9 very active grandkids (ages 13 - 5), all of whom live nearby and are at our house a lot, especially in the summer when they are swimming most of the day in our backyard pool.      We have 2 labs (both from Guiding Eyes released pups). Chelsea is almost 13 but very active and in excellent health, though she probably won't  pay a lot of attention to the pup. Daisy is nearly 8 and will want to play with the pup but will leave the pup alone and both will take naps often.  We sometimes have other dogs (a paramedic friend whose dog is with us about one day a week and has been for several years, and our grandkids dogs occasionally). All but one are female, and the male is neutered but he is unlikely to come over anyway.    We have a large, fenced in yard and a swimming pool in the center of it. Our 2 dogs have free run of the yard, which has gardens around the perimeter. We have an electric fence, but it is not turned on since both of our dogs are already trained on it and never leave the area - we have it to train them to stay out of most of the gardens, but we are pretty flexible with that.  Neither Daisy or Chelsea swim, but other dogs do, especially when the kids are in the pool - how about the Pup on this?    Our day usually starts early - about 6 a.m. when I will get up and let the dogs out, then feed them and let them out again - we will take the pup on a leash for this, of course, but our dogs will just go out by themselves - they know where in the  yard they are to go to poop and pee.  We will take the pup to the same area.  Then I go to 7 a.m.  Mass, then to the Y until about 10 a.m.  I would crate the pup at 7 am.  Scott gets up about 8 a.m and will play/train the puppy.  He is likely to be home until noon, when I will be home - then he goes to the Y. He comes home about 3 p.m., then I am likely to be out until dinner time, when we are both home for the evening. Occasionally we go out to dinner.  On weekends, our schedule is more hectic/varied - often around attending various sports events for the kids (can we take the pup with us to a soccer game for example - on leash, of course?)    On Tuesdays, I am gone all day - from 5:30 a.m. (so dogs get up early on 'Tuesday) until about 9 p.m. - am an EMT with the New Canaan Volunteer Ambulance. Scott is almost always home, but on the occasion he is not, one of my fellow EMT's (who will be very familiar with the program) will come care for the dogs.    Daisy and Chelsea do not jump on counters, go on beds or furniture, or chew on stuff.  We will have toys, etc for the pup and a crate in our kitchen/family room.  Daisy and Chelsea are not crated anymore.      In the near future - Scott will be gone for a week in early April, but I will have an EMT friend help my on the Tuesday he is gone. We have an annual Easter party and egg hunt on Easter (about 150 people, a lot of them kids) and the pup will need to be crated upstairs in a bedroom for about 4 hours during the party - that will be on April 20).  And we hare having a big weekend family reunion here at the end of July - shouldn't really interfere with training, but life will be a bit more hectic that weekend. Other than that - no big plans for anything else.  How do you feel about these things and the training?    We very much want to do this and have a successful pup that will go on to be a happy Guide Dog.  As we talked about on the phone, our biggest concerns are the many kids who will be here often (though all will know the ""rules"" and have dogs and are very excited about this, but kids are kids), the yard and our un-leashed dogs, and the pool.    Thanks so much for considering us for a puppy!    Scott and Melanie Barnard"

We also have a cat who has been around our dogs since she came to us as a kitten and even with claws, she NEVER swats the dogs.    Our daily routine:  Dave wakes between 5 and 6 a.m.  lets the dogs out, feeds them, lets them out again.  I usually wake at 5:45 am, go to the pool and swim, come home, dress and leave for work.  Dave will then take the 3 dogs and walk 4 miles. (We started walking 3 dogs when we had Belmont).  He is home with them most of the day except when he does errands; he grooms the shepherds a couple times a week and I groom the Yorkie once a month (bath and clipping).  He does a second walk later in the day depending on the temperature outside.  I come home from work and we are on the porch or relaxing inside and then eat dinner.  Before bed, the dogs go out again.  When we get the pup, I will adjust my routine to include a morning walk and an evening walk as well as ""play"" since Dave will not be able to walk 4 dogs.  I will also ensure the progressive socialization of the pup (had to do this with Tex); started with short walks in the cul de sac, then the next neighborhood, then the little shopping plaza up the street, etc.      Dave works for NVCC; he is an Associate Dean and Teacher; most of his work is virtual.  When regular semesters are in session, he goes into the campus for about 4 hours 2 - 3 times a week.  I live about 8 min. from my job and have flexibility with telework.  When we raised Belmont she went to work with me on the Metro a couple times a week (downtown D.C.).    I swim because of my lumbar discs; can't run anymore.  On the weekends I take the shepherds and play ball (which they love) to let them stretch their legs.  On Saturdays we often take the younger shepherd, Tex,  and the Yorkie (Huey) to Reston Town Center where James Oliver (DogU) has group socialization for many of his clients and their dogs.  We have been taking Tex out since he was a pup (almost 2 years now).    This has been a fabulous experience for the noise, kids, and crowd socialization.     We have 2 local grandkids (10 and 8) who have dogs and have been around our Belmont for the past 5 years.  They will spend the night a couple times a quarter.    Our schedules are very flexible and we both plan to take the Pup to work on various days after the little one earns his/her vest.    Weekends I take advantage of the time off to take the shepherds on a long walk on the bike path; they are champs and can handle the bikers, runners, and other dogs as well as strollers.    My personal work travel is minimal and very manageable; Dave does not travel.  Our personal travel; we will be going to Europe in Oct. for bike trip:)    I currently am an Adoption Coordinator for Lab Rescue and have been reducing my applicant pool so I am ""freed"" up when we get a pup.

496,Primary,4240,0,Montgomery,4L413,Lil,18812,01/14/14,"The Long household is a very active one with three teenage girls. We live in a suburban single-family two-story home with a fenced in backyard and a nice park across the street.    Typically it's a push to get everyone out by 7:45am to schools and work. Mom stays at home but has enjoyed some free-lance work predominately in her home office. School is dismissed at 3, so the kids return by 3:30, but different days have different kids home at different times depending on the sports season. Basically count on 2:30-8pm being a carpool extracurricular extravaganza with some kids left at home to mind supper and do homework. It is a rare night that anyone but Dad is out after 8. Dad works hard, and often late.    Julianna, 15, is a ballerina with classes T & Th 5-7pm at the school at the end of our street. She is also active in her school's theater department so in the spring there will be one ""Tech-Week"" where all hands are on deck and we don't see her until 10pm. She is a serious student who really looks forward to a companion to be with her and her laptop during those long study sessions.    Katie, 13, had knee surgery this fall. She no longer needs a brace and can bend her knee. She will use crutches for only one to two more weeks.  She has physical therapy on T/Th for 1 hour, but the doctor has told her no sports this spring. He has given her the green light to get a puppy -- as long as it's not a ""big"" puppy. Already, the whole prospect of raising a puppy has brightened her outlook tremendously. She can walk the dog on sidewalks, but won't be doing any off-roading in the woods of our neighborhood park anytime soon.    Lauren, 11, is over scheduled -- especially in the winter months.  She does year round swimming with practices 5-6pm M & W; is on the school basketball team with practices on Th nights 5:30-6:30 and games on Sunday afternoons and a few Sat nights; and is also on the White Tail Ski Team which involves one parent driving her up and back on both Saturdays and Sundays. We leave at 7am and get back around 3pm.  Some weekends we don't go both days -- especially if it is raining and too warm. The other girls don't participate in this, so they will be home during this time. Even though Lauren is the busiest schedule-wise, she is the youngest, most affectionate, and most playful.  I have witnessed her taking the neighbor's dogs out for walks in the rain, and I know she will be loyal beyond belief to this dog. She doesn't realize this, but she really does need to be older than somebody (anybody!) else in the house. This is her opportunity to be a big sister, and I know she can't wait.    My daughters are all very excited about doing this. They were raised to be social-minded and believe in giving back. They just didn't realize it could be so much fun! I think there will be some over-zealousness in the beginning, but given the realities of our hectic schedules, things will settle down. They are going to cover each other when needed and divvy up the chores and pleasures of having a pet in a chart so that they can share the responsibilities and the love.    Upon further reflection, we think we would prefer to have a female dog -- after all we do specialize in girls!  As you know, our previous GEB dog was a Golden, so a GLAB would be welcome as much as a Lab. We know all about the hair getting EVERYWHERE, so with that in mind, yellow is our preference but not an absolute requirement. (Vacuuming is going to be an item on that chore chart!)    Re:vacations - we take two weeks off in the summer typically in August. One with each set of Grand Parents. Often, we do vacation rental by owner, and there is a possibility of getting a dog-friendly house if it is ok with GEB to bring the puppy with us to the beach/mountains in NC or maybe even the Eastern Shore. We are happy to host other dogs for puppy swaps as well as when other raisers have trips planned.      Since the high school schedule does not match the elementary school schedule, we will not be going away for spring break.  Instead there is a 4-day weekend in Feb for President's Day, and Daddy is in dire need of a vacation with his family.  Nothing is set in stone yet, but we would like to raise a flag that we are likely to need coverage for that time.    I am really looking forward to being a part of the GEB community again. Things have changed quite a bit, so the girls will be on top of me as to what the current methods are and correct my old habits. Already I have enjoyed watching my daughters take this responsibility with such seriousness and vigor. They spur each other on to do the readings, to puppy-proof not only their rooms but the whole house, and to campaign their Dad into getting the puppy in January instead of ""who-knows-when!"" later in the year.  It has been heart warming, and the dog isn't even here yet! Thank you for giving the Longs such happiness already."

My husband then takes them out for a walk around the neighborhood (1 mile walk) before work. During the day since my husband is home they can go out in the fenced in yard as they please. In the evening it is dinner, homework, playtime or activities for all. For the dog we take them on an evening walk.    With a puppy we realize we have to change things up. I will take care of the puppy in the morning with feeding, getting busy and walk.

128,Primary,2366,0,Monroe,7KK15,Kimberly,20174,06/09/15,"Donna & Steve live in a two story house on 3 acres of property in Henrietta, NY.  No children. Our home sits in the middle of three acres outside of a housing track but on a somewhat busy road.  Plenty of side walks along the road and into the neighbor hoods/housing tracks, around us that work into an elementary school.  Most times the area is very quiet but the occasion loud picnic occurs.  Being in Henrietta has it good and bad.  Bad, it's a grid town and not a village to walk to different places.  Good, there are still plenty of businesses, plazas & mall, Town Hall, library, and grocery stores to sit and watch activities and still short distance drives.    We have raised 8 puppies for Guiding Eyes, last two being Halsa (7HH10) and her mom Shelby.  Puppy number 5, Verna, was a medical release who we adopted and is still with us today at the age  of 12.     We both work Monday - Friday.  Donna works 8:30am - 4:30pm; Steve varies from 4:30am - 2:00pm.  Donna works in an office at the University of Rochester where Halsa spent many days a week like her mom Shelby.  Steve is a route driver for a coffee company so no opportunity to have the puppy with him at work.  Our weekends are generally open to doing things around the house to family/friend events that may come up.  Sunday morning is church which will be an opportunity to socialize.    Both of us enjoy running races, 5K's, 10k's, 1/2 and full marathons during the year, more Steve than Donna.  Depending on locations and size of race, these have been good outings based on the puppy's age.  Lots to see but plenty of space to back away when needed.      We are looking forward to raising another puppy and hopefully one of Halsa's puppies to say we raised a mom, daughter and grand daughter.    Cheers -  Donna & Steve Derks"

As a teacher I want the children to learn that they have a responsibility as a citizen to give and do for others. They take great pride in helping these dogs  get ready to go to school with an autistic child.The dog visits are always the highlight of the day. The school administration is very accepting of the puppy as a part of the classroom.There is an appropriate space for the pup both indoors and outdoors. This is not something I would consider until the puppy was more aware of and connected to me, but I know it would be a great experience for the children and the puppy. Who knows...the pup may become a stage star. The Heeling Autism Dogs have been part of our class plays for the last 4 years!    So if the puppy is at home while I am at work, there are 2 options My husband is retired and is willing to be there for the puppy during the day. I am home by 4:00 and leave the house at 8:00. My neighbor, Liz Parrone, is taking the puppy raising class with me and is willing to be available as the puppy sitter when needed.    During the school year I live in a house so the puppy will have easy access to the outdoors. We have a great neighborhood with lots of kids on bikes, lawn mower mowing, babies in strollers, etc. I have easy access to sidewalks along quiet and busy streets, There is also access to towns with community activity. We also have a 6.5 year old chocolate lab who pales both intellectually and socially in comparison to GEB dogs. However she is very gentle, loving, playful and good-looking! There is space in the house to separate the dogs when it becomes too distracting or overwhelming for the puppy.     In June I will be retiring! At that point I will be full time with the puppy. We have a home on the eastern end of Long Island. The puppy will spend the majority of the summer out there, We have a fenced in backyard for the puppy as well as all the other benefits listed above from Westchester.

I walk the dogs using the basic rules of the owner so some may heel at my side at the left while others may walk slightly ahead on the right.

My husband was a high school science teacher. Therefore, we have no shortage of patience! We own our own home in a rural village. We have a great big yard...though it is not fenced. We are healthy & enjoy being outdoors. Together, we have raised healthy, well mannered dogs...a German Shepherd, a Golden Retreiver and most recently a Maltese!   Becoming puppy sitters at this time will enable us to help give to others. "

I have spent my life around dogs and have not spent a day without interactions with one. I attend school from 7am-2:30pm each day and otherwise am generally available, if not for other events. On weekends we remain at home in Cortlandt Manor but go out often to public places to run our daily chores. Nothing in the schedule is set in stone and we have plenty of time for the puppy. We currently have 2 dogs who are a border collie and a mutt which were adopted from shelters. We are active socially and physically allowing for a multitude of experiences for the dog. Our house is a large with a half acre of land which is fenced in and is throughly enjoyed by our dogs. We take our dogs on walks every day in nearby Blue Mountain Reservation along with many other people and their dogs allowing for a very social environment. We would love to become puppy raisers and feel our home would be an ideal environment for one such puppy."

Depending on the time of year, I may go for runs before or after work (weather dependent).  My weekends are usually for running errands and visiting friends.  I currently live with one other person in a 1st floor apt; however that person is not there very often (so I basically live alone).    I wish I could say that my life was very interesting, but I spend most of my time working, since I recently finished a graduate program with night classes.  However, I do currently have a flexible work schedule where I can work from home on some days; all companies that I have applied to have the same process (very important to me).  I like to think of myself as an active person, however... I enjoy going out and trying new things.  I was a long-distance runner prior to grad school... I hope to take back up the hobby.    I am in the process of applying for new jobs.  I should know by the end of the year where I will be working in the new year (if not sooner... I am waiting on an offer from 2 companies).  One company is in Norwalk, in which case I will stay living where I am.  The second company is in Buffalo, in which case I will live in Buffalo, NY during the weekday and Rochester, NY on the weekend.  The Rochester, NY location is a 3 story house with a small backyard, and I would be living with one other person.  This is the biggest life-changing event that may come up.    I travel some on the weekends... mostly to visit family.  Longest distance is 6 hours.    I am in good health.  I rarely go to the doctors and am very mobile."

My son fences two times a month at tournaments and my daughter has volunteered to take care of the puppy during those times.  When I run errands I plan on bringing the puppy so he can be socialized in different situations.  I am hoping once the puppy earns his jacket that many store owners will let him accompany me in the store.  We have a rabbit at home and a 7 year old Chihuahua so the puppy will be living with other animals.  Since the puppy is not allowed on furniture, the Chihuahua will have alone time on our bed so as not to be too overwhelmed with the puppy.  When we had puppies for home socialization, the Chihuahua generally ignored the puppies. She stayed on our bed in our bedroom- where she tends to hang out even without puppies in the house.  I will be the primary raiser but family member are eager to help out in raising the puppy.  "
30, ,0,0,Montgomery,,,,11/15/15,"Some people call me 26 going on 35 in terms of my lifestyle and I personally look at that as a compliment. My work is within walking distance so my weekday routine is usually waking up and getting ready around my 2nd floor hardwood apartment that is only accessible by stairs and then off I go to work around 8:30. I've always been a morning person from my times competitively swimming so I think there would be some major walks, playing, training sessions before we would go off to work.    My work at Discovery is on the 7th floor (that does have an elevator) is out of their global headquarters in Silver Spring that has a Sensory garden attached to the building as well as other walking areas accessible around Downtown Silver Spring. My job is in sales of corporate partnerships so I do spend a lot of time in front of the computer as well as internal meetings and jumping on conference calls. The way our floor is set up is that there are offices on the outer edges of the floor and then honeycomb cubes in the middle. I have a cube in a somewhat quiet area of the floor where I would envision my pup would be crated while I am away from my desk as well as for naps. If I'm running off to a meeting and as the pup progresses, I'd love to be able to bring them along to be involved in getting a great nap on the floor, and think my colleagues would be amendable to that.    I've left for work at about 8:30 and make my way home around 6ish. There are some ""boot camp"" options offered at work or I then make my way to my apartment gym if I can summon up energy to work out in that regard. My favorite exercise is saved for the weekend when I can bike in Rock Creek Park with no cars for a few hours.    There may be a day or two where I will need to be in NYC or Boston for work and I usually know about that a week or so ahead of time and would need to help have a puppy raiser take the pup since I'm not sure the Acela train or a flight up to Boston would be the best environment at first (or at all).    Weekends are filled with errands, the Silver Spring Farmer's Market, reading, watching football either at home or at a bar, visiting friends, or in the summer playing on the DC Bruins Alumni Softball team -- and now attending puppy classes.    I don't take many vacations away from DC, but if I do they are longer in nature. Every spring I usually look to take a week off of work and go abroad. In December with my family in Los Angeles, I usually take 2 weeks off to go visit them.    Since I live alone, my home life is pretty controlled as to how I like it and can be modified for the pup, the most attention will need to be placed on my work life as I need to maintain those standards there while also serving the puppy well."

33, ,0,0,Southern CT,,,,11/14/15,"I have the luxury of an incredibly flexible lifestyle.  I am a part time employee and I choose which days and times I work.  A typical day begins around 6:30am with a gentle wake-up nudge from my 6 year old Lab, Dee.  She is fed and we walk across the street, through the woods, and across a field to a beach where, if we are lucky, we catch the sunrise.  We often meet canine friends at the field:  2 Spinone Italianos, a terrier, a rescue hound and a gentle giant of a Burmese Mountain Dog.  Back home, we ease into the day.  In the morning I prefer to do errands, go to the local gym, or visit my parents at their Life Care Community.  I usually have lunch at home.  Afternoons are for housework, yardwork, paperwork, and such.  The afternoon dog walk occurs anywhere between 2:30 and 5:00 depending on the signals I get from Dee and how badly I want to get away from my chores.  Our neighborhood provides several different walking directions so I often let Dee point the way she wants to go.  Dee is fed around 5-5:30.  We hang out, cuddle, and play through the evening and she goes out one last time around 10:00 before bed.  Weekends are pretty much the same.  My adult daughter (23) lives in the house, too and is very excited about the prospect of puppy sitting; she participated in many Susquehanna Service Dog activities in Harrisburg PA.  I rent a 2000 square foot home along the Neck River on an acre of land.  I have the landlady's permission to puppy sit for GEB.  Summer cottages on one side are rarely inhabited and woods border the other side.  We share a driveway with a family whose home is between mine and the road.  It's a quiet coastal neighborhood.  The End.  "
34, ,0,0,Montgomery,,,,11/14/15,"I work only 3 days per week but they are long days. ( 13 hour shift in a hospital as a nurse practitioner, plus my work is one hour away each way)  So on work days I am gone ALL DAY..but then I have 4 days off.  I live alone with my 11 year old dog- GSD mix, female, rescue, have had her since she was ~ 8 months.  We live in a 2 br condo in North Bethesda.    Off days I get up at normal time (6-730), have a quiet morning , go to the gym, do any errands, and am frequently free and at home in the afternoons.  I would say on average I am out for 2-4 hours or so.  Sometimes go out in the evenings, kind of normal life. I have plenty of time on days off to engage the puppy in learning experiences.  There are ample different walks I can do with my puppy in my neighborhood and I can take the puppy to many different places for experiences.  The area I live in is full of condos and townhouses, and there are many opportunities for practicing dog greetings with all shapes and sizes.  I don't go to the dog park anymore because my dog is older and has some issues with arthritis, so it was not recommended by my vet.  I have talked with Jean about working with a secondary raiser or being a secondary raiser, and I want to talk about good options for my schedule needs and the best way to set the puppy up for success.  My work days are different every week; however, I could try to work out a predictable cycle starting in March.   (My schedule is done until end of February but I can make switches).  I do work every 4th weekend and one summer and one winter holiday per year.  Weekends that I am off, have the same schedule as weekdays off, as above.  But if I am paired with a co-raiser for the puppy's needs it would have to work with my schedule.  I would consider when the puppy is older to look into bringing the puppy to work with me, but I think we should discuss that first.  If for some reason I go in for a meeting or training, again, I would talk with my workplace about bringing puppy with me for experience.  My dog is healthy, has some arthritis, but still manages to jump on my bed.  We are up one flight of stairs outside to my front door, then mostly on one level but I also have a loft.  I have extendable fences, dog beds, plenty of dog stuff for play,etc. and can separate my dog from the puppy to give them both breaks, and still have visualization of the puppy, that is not a problem.  I think my dog would do better with a male puppy, she does ok with female dogs unless they are both the alpha -- she has never bitten but she has asserted her authority, mostly with females and mostly when she was younger.  She does not have toy or food aggression.  She is very attached to me though.  We have had weekend visitors (female Cairn terrier) who pretty much left her alone and my dog was fine. I think my dog would be tolerant of a puppy.  I have taken her to obedience classes as a puppy but it was not positive training based, so I am eager to learn better puppy training methods.  She has also completed therapy dog certification and we used to visit a nursing home in NY, have not found a place to visit here yet.    When I go out of town it may be to my families house in NY ( My parents- no children in the house.  I bring my dog and would bring the puppy- car ride), or on work or personal short trips, usually not longer than 3-5 days, I don't like to leave my dog longer than that.   Would be happy to talk about best options for my work situation and how to maximize working with the puppy.    Thanks!"

Every weekend I get rides home to Cumberland, RI to spend time with my boyfriend and family. I will most likely not be raising until my senior year and I am currently a freshman. Usually on holidays I will go home to work and will be home in Cumberland every weekend, for most holidays, and for all breaks from school. If my parents decide to move closer to URI, I would raise a puppy at a house with them and find a job near school, and would have them available to care for the puppy if I was unable to bring the pup with me. I would not be able to change the fact that I go home every weekend unless my parents moved closer, which would then be an off-campus living arrangement in which a puppy would be welcome. For now, I hope to do on-campus sitting and occasional sits over breaks so that I can still participate fully in the club and help out the raisers."

I love dogs though I never had one but would truly love to have one. I am a housewife and have all the time to devote myself to raising a guiding dog. It is such a noble cause to help a blind person experience this beautiful world once again without the hassle of getting around. This is my chance to work for a social cause and at the same time work with a puppy and understand the commitment, care and training involved in raising a nice family pet. This program will help me with all the techniques, tricks and at the same time provide support in raising a pup. This educational program will help me when we have our own pet dog in the future. Me and my husband are committed to learning and understanding the key concepts involved in raising a calm, composed and an intelligent animal. Also since I am new to this country this program will help me socialize, make new friends and give me a platform to express my self and work for the benefit of my community.   Since I am not working and we don't have kids I have plenty of time to give specialized care to the pup. We live in Herndon VA in an apartment (1 bed).

My schedule is extra heavy right now because I would like to raise as a senior. Right now I typically wake up an hour before classes to get ready for school and eat breakfast. My weekday class schedule is extremely variable; on somedays I have two classes but others I have classes/meetings from 8:30 AM until 6:00 PM. In addition to classes I work in an animal behavior lab that studies corticosterone and the stress response in tree swallows, and I am co-vice president of the biology scholars program. Neither of those two extracurriculars are incredibly time consuming, but they do constrain the amount of time I have to study in a single day. On days where I have few classes/no meetings, I spend my time working in the library, but I would certainly be able to devote time to a puppy on a day like this! I spend most of my weekends relaxing with my boyfriend and friends, so weekends are also a great time for me to puppy sit!

On the weekend almost all of my time is devoted to my dog, except for the few hours I work on Saturday, and when I go to ride my horse at the barn. Tucker comes with me to the barn sometimes since it is where I work and spend a lot of free time. Tucker always sleeps through the night, and I usually wake up before him! We live in a house with two other housemates and another dog (small chihuahua mix). I leave to go home on all school breaks, and Tucker comes with me. As you can see, he's basically my whole world because you asked me to write about myself and I ended up writing about him! "

I plan on sitting not raising a dog as I have a very hectic schedule that changes all of the time and is never consistent.     Example Schedule  Wake up at 6:30  Leave for School at 7:30   and then depending on the day, I could come home for lunch anywhere between 11 and 1, then I could be done with classes and would stay home OR  Come home from classes at 5:00 pm   Dinner & Studying  Bed at 10 pm "
60, ,0,0,Fingerlakes,,,,10/03/15,"I live an active lifestyle on a college campus. I am almost constantly surrounded by people and activity. I have a heavy course load so sometimes it is difficult to find some ""me-time"" to just relax or focus on my work. While I do live on a college campus, I have one dog and one cat at home which would give me great opportunities for socialization sessions. While sitting, I will be on campus but by the time I am raising, I hope to be living off campus in a less active environment. It will be in an apartment that is likely to have neighbors around. However, Ithaca has a great variety of places I could take the puppy for exercise and activity. While I may live in a more calm area, I will still spend a lot of time on campus and in busy environments. I do like to go home for weekends occasionally to visit my family and this is where I am least flexible. Of course, I can plan ahead but my family is an important part of my life. Home is only 1.5 hours away so this would give a good opportunity to socialize my puppy with cars and transportation. Currently, I am also working on top of my course load so I am busy but my work schedule is extremely flexible. I can work as many or as little hours a week as I would like. At home, I work a full time job during the summer, however, I work for a family business so this too is flexible. "

62, ,0,0,Monroe,,,,09/30/15,So for the time being I will simply be a puppy sitter and mainly helping when I can with Lauren and Meredith.  I am a graduate student so my days vary considerably. I sometimes have rather long days but they are entirely dictated by me for how long I am at work allowing me plenty of freedom to come home and take the dog out.  I do not have a set time to arrive or a set time to leave.  I spend most of my time at work and otherwise I spend my time around the house reading for work or relaxing.  There is very little in my schedule that is not flexible and very little that I would have trouble doing.  I live in an apartment but it is only a single flight of stairs up so that is no issue.  I do fly home to washington about once or twice a year but that is normally for about a week.  I do some socializing on the weekend but that is rarely for more than a few hours at a time and typically lead a pretty quite life of work and rest.  I tend to be a relatively early riser and am quite active.  I would see no major issues in terms of time or commitment for this.

This being said, I am hoping to move off campus after my junior year and am open to raising a puppy then.  My schedule consists of going to class and my research position as well as playing basketball twice a week with the Cornell women's club basketball team.  Other than classes my schedule is very flexible.  Over the breaks I usually get a job however I would be living at home so the puppy would have someone to look after him/her.  On the weekend I am very free and usually only have parts of my research to do.  I am really looking forward to being part of the Guiding Eyes team!"
64, ,0,0,South Western CT,,,,09/30/15,"For being a sitter, my availability would be limited to mostly weekends.  I‚Äôm usually up early on weekends around 6:00 ‚Äì 6:30 am.  Our weekends usually include an outdoor activity like hiking.  We live in a rural neighborhood with wooded areas around our property with a large backyard.  It is very quiet with not too much activity.  Some neighbors do have dogs, but they do not roam and stay in their yards which are not close.  There are also many rail trails we take advantage of for exercise in our town.  There are no children in the house or other animals.  We have had many years of experience caring for our two large shepherd mixes until we lost them both to old age.

67, ,0,0,Eastern MA,,,,09/23/15,"My schedule is anything but typical. I'm a grad student at Boston College so I work from home a great deal. I have to be on campus for a couple of hours a week for classes and meetings, some of which are weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or none-of-the-above. Between now and May 2016, my class commitments are a one hour lecture each on Monday and Wednesday, which take me 30 minutes to commute to and from, meaning I am out of the house for two hours total. I have a bi-weekly seminar class from 8am to 11am on Tuesdays, which will be more infrequent as the semesters wane (i.e. in Nov/Dec and Mar/Apr). I work part-time in the evenings on campus from 4pm-9pm on Mondays and Wednesday, meaning I am out all night and don't get home until 9:30pm. Otherwise, my schedule is my own as I work on writing my dissertation and finishing my Ph.D. this year. My class commitments will likely increase as I enter the final year of my program in August 2016, but not before then. I have no work commitments from mid-December to mid-January, and from mid-May to late August. I will occasionally have to take trips to attend conferences in my field, but these almost invariably occur over weekends when my fiance is off.    My fiance leaves home Monday through Friday at 6:45am, and is home by 5:50pm. She has permission from her employer to flex her schedule somewhat to accommodate the days where I have to leave early for my 8am class, so that the pup is home for no more than 3-4 hours by the time I get home by 11:30am, as well as to arrive home early in the event that I have a meeting on a day where I also work in the evening (which happens occasionally). This is our biggest organizational change regarding the puppy but one that is eminently handleable, given that I also have standing permission to miss classes every now and then should an unavoidable conflict emerge.    We spend our weekends either at home, visiting with her family at their lake house property in New Hampshire (they have a two-year old 30lb Aussiedoodle named Max, who has a reputation for being excellent with other dogs (very submissive) even as he is a tad unruly when it comes to house manners), visiting her brother Shaun in Burlington VT (who is a GEB puppy raiser himself) or hosting out-of-town friends in Boston. We like to get out and take walks at the weekend, and sometimes to go watch movies if there is something interesting out. In the winter, we usually plan day trips to go skiing in Vermont and New Hampshire a few times a season, including one substantial three-day weekend trip to Stowe in March. For the most part, we envision spending most of our weekend with a puppy if we are placed with one. On Sundays in the Fall and early winter, we watch football.    We live on the fourth floor of an apartment building in Waltham, near the Charles River walkway and Prospect Park. Our building is dog friendly. Long-term, we have a trip planned for a week to the U.K. to visit my family and attend a friend's wedding in May, 2016. I'd say we cross the pond annually to see my parents, although I'm counting on a puppy enticing them to make the trip our way a bit more often!"
70, ,0,0,Monroe,,,,09/20/15,"I work three days a week for 9 hour days about 25 minutes from home plus occassional Wednesday nights and weekends.  My days off vary from week to week.  My husband Jeff works from home or an office less than 5 minutes away. Jeff is out of town for 4-5 days once a month. (when he is out of town, I am usually off).  We have a son who is a freshman in high school and a daughter who is a freshman in college in Washington state. Our son is excited about raising a guide dog puppy and wants to be involved.     When I work, I usually end at 5, but can end up there longer.  Making 6 pm classes is hard, but I would plan on meeting my husband there with a puppy if needed.    We live on 70 acres near a small town.  We have 3 dogs, 4 cats (2 in the house, 2 in the barn) and 2 horses.  We hike a lot with the youngest dog.  We also walk all 3 dogs on the property most days.  We often take the dogs into town for a walk too.  We take the dogs with us whenever we can- eg Tractor Supply store.  Our oldest dog is a 12 year old male who can be aggressive towards other adult dogs. He has 2 torn ACLs and arthritis and is a bit unstable.  He has been good with every young puppy he's met.  I'm not sure how he'd be with an older male puppy that he doesn't know that came into the house so for puppy swaps we'd probably do better with younger puppies.      We have an active lifestyle.  We don't have a very set schedule or routine. We spend a lot of time with our animals.  We don't have many evening commitments currently so once we get home from work, we usually stay home unless we have errands to run.    We travel several times a year and get a housesitter when we're gone.  "

I lead an active lifestyle - love to walk, hike, bike ride, snowshoe, etc.  I live in a two-bedroom condo (one floor) but I have a big backyard and I live right on the rails to trails path which is a great place to walk dogs.  My weekends are mostly free and I would love to take care of a dog on weekends or during one of my school vacations.  I love dogs but I feel that I am away too long during the day so I hope that volunteering for GEB is a good way for me to support an excellent organization as well as enjoy a dog for a brief period of time as a sitter.  The well-being and safety of the dogs is of the utmost importance to me and I hope that I will be able to help care for GEB dogs whenever I am able to do so.  "
72, ,0,0,Monroe,,,,09/19/15,"My wife, Anne, already gave a pretty thorough answer on her quiz, but I'll hit on a few of the key points.    We live in West Henrietta in a 2 bedroom apartment (about 1,200 square feet, so a good deal of space).  Anne works at RIT (about 10 minutes away) and has a somewhat flexible schedule. I work remotely for my company, but do travel to sub-saharan Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia, etc‚Ä¶) about 2-3 times per year for about 2-4 weeks at a time. Next year, I will also be traveling back and forth to Southern California for work some of the time starting in June.  My parents live in North Carolina and Anne's live in Southern California, so we also visit them. Because of our travel schedules this fall, we won't be able to take on a puppy full-time until January. We would like to be full-time puppy raisers, but we do travel a bit, so we'd be open to being puppy sitters if it doesn't work out to do full-time puppy raising.    When I am in Rochester I work from home and am around all of the day, so I could take the puppy out for walks, feed it, etc‚Ä¶.We live on the second floor, but can be outside very quickly to take care of the puppy's needs.  In our apartment complex/neighborhood there are other dogs, but people are good and keep them on leashes.  There is a nice pond to walk around.  On weekends, we keep it low key and like to get out and about. We don't have any other non-work activities that take too much of our time in terms of being involved in other groups, but the nature of our work sometimes means working at odd hours.     Currently, we have no kids, but we will let you know if that changes in the future.  We're still a year or two away from that most likely.     Hope that helps!  Thanks!  "

I live in an apartment, the entire downstairs of a house. I currently have a year and a half old female dog, named Roo. I trained her myself and I consider her very well behaved and advanced in manners and tricks. (She loves other dogs) My school schedule this semester is pretty packed, however all classes I go to currently I could see the dog going with me! I do not work currently because of school. I do sometimes travel to see my friend in New York, but I usually bring my dog, so if allowed the dog could come with me and be fully attended to, or I could use a sitter from school.     My day to day consists of waking up, playing with my dog for as long as I can before school. I love taking her to the dog park, getting lots of exercise, bringing her out and about wherever she is welcome. I am excited for this puppy because I think I will be able to provide it with the exposure to new environments, while making the puppy feel secure and safe.     I really am so thankful for this opportunity and so ready to help you all help others! Thank you!  "

After all my classes are done I typically either begin studying or take a nap. After an hour of doing one of those activities I go to extra tutoring on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (All optional). Those typically end around 5 leaving me extra time to do other homework, eat or hang around somewhere. I currently live on campus, but will be living off campus either next semester or next fall. On the weekends I have a job at Goodwill which does allow dogs inside the store, service dogs or not. My work schedule varies on Saturdays but are the same on Sundays (10am-6:30 pm). I do have asthma so I tend not to do an excessive amount of exercise or activities. When at home (in a one family house) I do have a niece who is a year and a half and I also have 3 dogs, all of which are vaccinated (1 male-neutered, 2 females-not spayed).

The girl is a golden retriever who is neutered. The boys are setters who aren't neutered. All three are very good with each other and get along well. My job hours are chaotic. I work for, usually, 8 hours but how many days in a week varies by schedule. If I need to come home to let the puppy out, I can come home on my meal break.

Weekend:  Try to get up a little later!  Similar for dog- usually a longer walk. Other activities, may include attending youngest son's sports events or visiting older sons (2 away college, 1 lives in Fairport).    Our family lifestyle is pretty active, we enjoy outdoor activities (our property backs onto the Crescent Trail, so hiking is easy!). We have a swimming pool (fenced in) and enjoy being in the backyard whenever the weather allows!    Our dog is a mixed breed (kind of looks like a bearded collie, but we are unsure of his heritage!). His name is Moose and he just turned 8 so he is pretty calm (except for chipmunks!!). He has had recent interaction with a couple of puppies - one of which stayed in our house several times last year and after initial excitement he settled down with them being around, so I wouldn't anticipate any problems there, but a less ""boisterous"" or calmer puppy would probably be better received! :)    Hope this is helpful information, if you need more details please ask.

77, ,0,0,Eastern MA,,,,09/13/15,"I am a 26 year old female with a long-time boyfriend and no kids. I live in Brookline with 1 female roommate who is in her early 30's and is excited to help out with the GEB puppy. Our apartment is on the 3rd floor (walk up) and very spacious/open. It is tucked back off of the street with a grassy courtyard out front. I live within a 5 minute walk to Armory Park which is large, open park that is also pet-friendly. Monday-Friday I work at the hospital down the street from my apartment. I leave at approximately 8am and return around 4:15. My job is very flexible and laid back and I am rarely if ever required to stay late or longer than planned. I can also work remotely from home one day a week. My close friend who will be co-raising with me started grad school this fall and lives in South Boston but owns a car so she can easily transport the puppy between our homes and to classes/vet appointments as necessary. She only has classes a few hours a week so she will be able to help out with the puppy in the early stages when it would be unable to be crated for long periods of time.  On weekends I do not have any regular commitments. I often run errands in the back bay/downtown area. I also like outdoors activities and attend a multitude of city events such a farmer's markets, fairs, etc.  Additionally I often babysit for a family in the back bay (most weekends for 4-5 hours). They have 2 boys (4 and 7) and we regularly go to parks, the esplanade, the boston children's museum, science museum and boston public library. Once the puppy is old enough and vaccinated I would take it with me on these weekend outings with the kids! My boyfriend's family lives in Hingham and a few times each month we take the commuter rail there to visit with his family and go to lunch or various outing with them. I live a very social, active life and often frequent new places within the greater boston area. My life, apartment, and job are very stable and predictable. I am at the point where I feel like I have all of the necessary resources and time to dedicate to this GEB puppy process.  I intend to include this puppy in every aspect of my life and commit all of my time and energy to make them a great future guide dog!"

My apartment for the most part is sound proof which is nice.  My apartment manager knows that I would like to take on a guiding eyes dog and she loves the idea of it and even said if I decide to do it she will wave the costs for having a dog in the apartment.  I live with a roommate that is excited to be part of this experience as well.  We have no other animals in the apartment, not even a fish.  I attend school from 8am-11am on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays I have clinical from 3pm-9pm.  However, my roommate will be home around 4:30pm to be with the dog.  There are plenty of parks around the area and dogs are allowed on my campus.  My weekends are pretty flexible unless I go home to see my family which the dog could go with me! The only thing I see changing in the next year would be the fact that I would be graduating college and then would be moving back to Syracuse and living with my parents who own a farm.  The farm has tons of animals and our house is always full of visitors.  We own 5 horses, 3 goats(one that is pregnant with twins), chickens, 3 rabbits, a barn cat, and 3 dogs.  Two of the dogs are neutered males(one is actually a chocolate lab) and the other dog is a spayed female.  All of the dogs get along with other dogs.

79, ,0,0,Monroe,,,,09/13/15,"My typical work day is fairly flexible, but does include lots of run-around. I work at RIT which is a 5-10 minute drive from where I live. I am a post-doctoral researcher there on a three-year project to study the skills necessary for entry and success in the Rochester optics and photonics workforce. This basically means, I run around town interviewing people at different companies, have some meetings during the day, and work from a computer from my office, home, or a coffee shop on occasion. Sometimes I work through the day and sometimes I come home for lunch. For the puppy, my schedule is pretty flexible and my time is blocked in 1-2 hour increments so I could always come home in between things as needed. My husband, Jimmy, works remotely and is home all day but does travel two to three times per year. There will be times when he will be working in Sub-Saharan Africa for a few weeks and I will need to adjust my schedule to be home more, but when he is home he can help with puppy potty training and other workday needs too. After work, we usually go outside to walk, run, swim, or sit with a book on the balcony. I would like to take a puppy for walks so that we can both get outside more or play on the long line out on the grass during those times. Jimmy and I enjoy cooking a lot so we'll try out new recipes in the evenings too or watch a little TV (right now we are getting into the Outlanders series). That pretty much sums up most weekdays.    Our weekends are pretty relaxed. I try to stay in town for most weekends to ride and take care of my horse, Stetson. I usually go to the barn for 2-3 hours on Saturdays and/or Sundays and occasional weekday evenings. Jimmy goes for runs and we both like hiking and walking around new places. We moved to New York from California and have been exploring our new environment with little day trips to see the lakes or walk around Rochester. I also enjoy quiet time at home with a good book and Jimmy really likes watching sports games. We live in a second-floor apartment in West Henrietta, NY where we have lots of walking trails and dog-friendly neighbors. Dogs are allowed in the apartment village here, but we do not have our own yet. We don't have children yet either and probably won't have one soon, but will keep our GEB region representatives posted if that changes at any point (I'm just trying to be completely honest about our lifestyle and future life plans). Our lifestyle is pretty relaxed overall.    Because we have family in North Carolina and California we do travel to see them occasionally, especially for Christmas and sometime in the summer. We have already bought plane tickets for this Christmas coming up to go to California so likely we would not be able to take a young puppy with us that soon and should start training sometime in January, 2015. Anything past that though, we can work closely with other raisers to time puppy swaps, plan ahead with our region's puppy sitters, or go on a road trip to the GEB North Carolina region with an older puppy. Jimmy and I occasionally travel for conferences too, but these are usually at different times from each other. For the most part, our travels and schedules are pretty flexible and we just try to plan things in advance as much as possible. Traveling is one area that I thought it would be important to discuss though in terms of making sure we find the right volunteer opportunity. While my preference is to be a puppy raiser, I am happy to volunteer in whatever capacity makes the most sense for the puppies' and GEB's needs.     Not quite a novel, but I hope that gives you an idea of our routines and general lifestyle."

This way I could walk the dog around in the afternoon and every couple of hours when it if first a pup. I work in Downtown Baltimore, near the harbor east section so it would be a very nice area to walk the dog around. On days that I cannot bring the pup into the office I know my mom would be able to take him/her. She works in a hospital office and this is a much quieter and low key place.

I am a student so I will be at school during the day weekdays but my school will allow the puppy to come to school with me some days of the week and i also take extra classes online when I Get home from school and key club. then on the weekends i usually hang out with my friends or go visit my family, things the puppy will be welcome to join in on so ill take the puppy with me whenever i can, pretty much wherever i go on the weekend. My mom works 4 days a week, so she will be home with the puppy every Thursday while I am at school and my dad works very locally and has a flexible schedule so he will be able to stop home and check on and let the puppy out while I am at school. I currently have 2 pet dogs one black lab ( witch is why we are hoping to get a yellow lab as the guide dog) and one mixed dog, so my family is used to having dogs around. so theirs nothing too specific that we need the dog to be just That the puppy is people friendly because we plan to have him around people a lot. so that is pretty much it."

I am an animal lover, and I cannot remember a time in my life when I did not have at least one pet.  I am a graduate of the Animal Behavior College and have trained several dogs in our area, including my own.  My last chow chow, Sutcha GoodGirl, was welcome wherever I went.  I took her everywhere.  She went to stores, restaurants, and even to church.  The people in the church were very impressed with how obedient she was when all I did was point to the pew and she would move over and get under it. My husband and I tried to go on a one day road trip once a week and she always went with us. I plan on doing the same with my future guide dog.  We will go on picnics and go to our local park to feed the ducks and geese.  I know she will be welcome in our grocery stores, restaurants, and, of course church.  She will go with me every place I go.  I have a two year old granddaughter who will love her, and she will play with her when she can. I am not used to my life without a dog in my life and I am looking forward to raising and training a new puppy to become a productive member of society to help a vision Impaired person have the independence he or she deserves.     "
104, ,0,0,Ohio,,,,07/05/15,"I have to wait until the fall before getting a puppy because I was asked to take a full-time assignment for 8 weeks, when normally I work part-time. I am a Children's Librarian and am scheduled to work 16 hours a week. To support myself, I take sub jobs through the library which are usually 4-hr. shifts. Depending on the week, I work 8 hrs. on either a Saturday or Friday. Currently, my schedule is Tuesday mornings, 9-1, Thursday evenings, 5-9, and 8 hrs. on either Friday or Saturday, totaling 16 hrs. In the fall, I will be switching to Wednesday evenings, which works out for the weekly puppy classes in Berea. As far as my job goes, I don't know yet whether a puppy would be welcome because I do story time and programs. I will find out, though. The Friday and Saturdays worry me the most, but I plan to hire a co-worker to come let the puppy out halfway through the day. However, if allowed, perhaps I can bring the puppy for part of the day on a Friday or Saturday.    When I went to the first mtg., the speaker said we were supposed to have the puppy fit into our schedule, not the other way around. This is vastly different than what I'm used to. I've always rearranged my schedule around my dogs and other family members, so it will be a good learning opportunity for me. I also read on the site that adult dogs sleep 13 hrs. a day. That would alleviate my guilt somewhat from leaving the puppy and doing other things.  I think this program would be good for me as well as the puppy because I need to see the puppy as a worker to be trained, not as one of my furry children. I probably need the discipline as much as the puppy does!    I live alone in a ranch-style house, and both my front and backyard are fully fenced in. Before my last dog died, I had a guy come to scoop the poop, and I plan to continue with that. I am hoping to borrow a crate from my daughter so that I will have 2 crates for the puppy. I would like to have one in the bedroom that doesn't have to be moved around. My vet and her staff are very kind and loving, and I've always felt very comfortable taking my dogs to them.    My dog, Penny, just died in May, and although I miss her, I realize that it was her time. The vet came to my house to euthanize her. This happened for her sister dog as well, last January. I felt that even though it was extremely expensive, that my dogs deserved to die at home rather than suffer the anxiety of going to the vet at this stage. I love my dogs.     What else? I would prefer NOT to have a German Shepherd. I can deal if that's the only option available, though.    I'm in relatively good health, although I do take some medication. I live in a suburb of Cleveland, and the puppy will have room to run in my yard. My daughter has her own dog who visits, but I plan to hold off on the puppy and Holly meeting until the puppy is settled. I worry  that Holly will teach the puppy bad habits, even though I will be hyper vigilant about training.    My biggest fear is my failure on behalf of the puppy and the program. It is such a worthwhile endeavor, it worries me that I might mess up. However, I have been doing extensive research and as long as I have guidance, it should be okay. Basically, I have to relearn how to raise a dog in the correct way without spoiling it or treating it like one of my children.    I will be sad to see the puppy go, but I also know that it is for a wonderful reason. I have a great need to help others, and that's why I became a librarian because it's the very nature of the job. I have also volunteered at hospice, been a board member of Angel House, volunteered at the store of the animal shelter, been a Girl Scout troop leader, and a PTA mom. Because this opportunity is one where I am helping someone I may never even meet, I'm glad to let go of the puppy because it means enriching someone's life.    I'm not sure what else to tell you, and this is all free flow writing, so I hope it makes sense. I can't think of anything else dog-related, so just know that I love dogs and love to help. Because I live in the town where the classes are being held, it's also very convenient.    Just thought of something--each week, we are sent a flyer with coupons and ads from local businesses. I usually throw it in the recycle bin without even opening it. Well, one day as I was about to throw it away, the wind blew it open to the exact page for Guiding Eyes for the Blind. The tagline read something like, ""If you love dogs..."" and I said, ""Uh oh"" to myself because I had a funny feeling. I thought that it probably wouldn't work out for me because I don't like to travel all over the place, but I went to the website anyway just to check, I learned that the classes were in the same city in which I lived! Well, I figured this was a sign, but then learned that the classes are held on Thursday nights when I work. Then I remembered that my schedule was switching to Wednesday nights, thereby freeing up Thursday nights for puppy classes. I feel as though I'm meant to do this, so I will give it my all.    You did say ""write a novel,"" so there you have it.    Namaste,  Lisa Wurch"

I work at my kitchen table (and will need to work out some puppy-proofing for my computer cables).  I am usually able to take short breaks of 5-10 minutes every hour, and longer breaks (15 min) every 2-3 hours.  My 17-year old daughter stays in my home 3-4 days per week, and will be involved with training and interacting with the puppy.  Neither of us have any physical limitations.  We have two cats in the home - one is not afraid of dogs, and one is very afraid of everything.  In general, they just avoid dog contact.    We have a large home with a lot of open space for playing and training.  We have a very large yard with a big, fenced area.  There are a lot of natural residents in the yard - bunnies, squirrels, dear and groundhogs.  Our neighbors homes are a fair distance away, but they have dogs who we can hear barking, but cannot see.  People walk their dogs regularly in the neighborhood - we rarely have issues with loose dogs.  I anticipate that I would take the puppy for on-leash walks outside of the yard as appropriate.  There is also a large field with paths nearby.  I live within 5 minutes of at least 5 strip malls from small to large size, and varying levels of ""busyness"".  There are also sidewalks around the YMCA where I exercise where we could walk and have light to moderate interaction.    I work out at the local Y almost daily, and if my daughter isn't home, I would leave the pup crated for about 90 minutes while I'm gone.  On the weekends I am usually running errands, going to visit friends or participating in activities that would be no more than 2-3 hours in length.

Regardless of what we have in a day, mornings are always open for at least one of us. We wake up, make breakfast, and usually have some extra time before we need to do anything (errands, rehearsals, catering, etc). This gives us a lot of time to be able to take care of the dog's needs to set him up for a good day. Nights are always open for Matt once he is home from work, and Erin would either teach from home or have to leave for a concert, leaving the dog with Matt, or even bringing the dog along!    Sometimes we have a weekend or a few days during the week that are completely insane for us. Our plan to handle this with a dog is to get help from Erin's mom and stepfather, who are GEB sitters and are willing to get their certifications renewed in order to help us out.    Although we don't have a set schedule all the time, we are aware that we need to coordinate so that the dog is never left alone for too long. This won't be difficult for us given the parameters of our jobs, which often involve gigs that are only 2-3 hours at a time and allow us to go home frequently.

Work is also a ""bring your dog with you"" environment once the dog is house broken.)  3:00-3:30 Emily, Matthew come home from school (during cross country season this will be later -- 5:00-6:00).  3:30 Emily takes our dog for a walk.  4:00 Debbie arrives home (somewhat flexible -- takes dog out if Emily wasn't able to).  6:00-7:00 Paul arrives home (flexible, but not flexible enough to be home before 3:00 most of the time.  8:00 Debbie/Paul take our dog for a walk.    Other notes:  Debbie, Emily and Matthew are off for the summer.  If we get the puppy in June, we would only have a couple of months where we would need our schedules to be super flexible.    Matthew plays soccer and has games on weekends and practices during the week.  Currently, his practices are pretty late -- 7:30 - 9:00 and someone else can be home easily but we don't know for sure what his schedule will be next year as he is entering high school. The puppy can come to soccer practice.    Matthew is a fairly active teenager and likes to go outside and kick the soccer ball or otherwise let off steam when he gets home.

Our typical school/work day begins at 5:45 a.m. I start by making my girls their lunch and breakfast followed by trips to the bus stop. Eleanor is the last one to leave for school at about 8:30. The rest of the school day is filled with household chores, PTA meetings (I'll be our high school's PTA president-elect next year), and errands. I like to walk or go for a run to exercise.  The girls return home from school starting about 2:45. The rest of the day typically involves a few sports/activity drop-offs and pick ups, followed by dinner. We're all in bed between 9 and 10 p.m.     Weekends are typically filled with sporting events, errands, social events, and family outings.  Weekends are busy, but someone is almost always at home at any given time throughout the weekend.     We live in a two-story house in a suburban neighborhood.      We have a 9-year-old yellow lab, LIberty.  We adopted her at the age of one after her family abandoned her, so we did not have the opportunity to train her, although Eleanor still tries to work on Liberty's manners/behavior. Although she is not well trained, Liberty is a very sweet, good natured dog who enjoys the company of other dogs. We've taken her on vacation several times with other families who've also brought along a dog, and we've never had a problem.  Liberty has developed hip issues this past year. Surgery is not recommended at this point, but she is no longer allowed to go on regular walks.  We do still take her out to play regularly.              "

I go to work at 8 AM at Alternative Paths Training School, a school for autistic students.  Tilly goes with me and volunteers all day as the therapy dog.  The school has thoroughly invested in the idea of having a puppy being at school, in my office( I am the school nurse, so I am in a clinic office with lots of space), in a crate or leashed, during school hours. They understand that this dog is being trained for the visually impaired, not for Heeling for Autism. And they understand that we will have to give the puppy/dog up when IFT occurs. All children must be pre-approved and have permission from parents and me in order to be physically in contact with Tilly, as well as the puppy.  School days are 8 hours so I have lunch there and return home at 4 PM.  I work around the yard, go for more extensive walks, and visit on the weekdays and weekends with children and grandchildren.  I have a few groups that I participate in once a month during the evenings, but not every evening. I will be going on some weekends in the summer to supervise care for my Uncle in North Carolina.    My husband will be co-raising, and works as a newspaper publisher in the Alexandria area.  He has flexible hours and will often be working from home during the mornings.  He has occasional evening hours, but generally does not travel or have business obligations on evenings or weekends.

During the summer, aside from a 2-week trip out of the country, I don't really have a lot of other plans, so I can focus on puppy training. This will be especially helpful when housebreaking the puppy, because I won't have to worry as much about interrupting my sleep to let the dog out if I don't have school the next day!     Generally, I leave for school at 7:45 and return around 3:30, though about once a week I get home at 5 because of club activities. My dad works from home most days, and my sister usually gets home at 2:30 or so, so they can take care of the puppy when I'm not there. However, sometimes I'm the first one home, at around 3:30. My mom works fairly close by, so she can come home to let the puppy out during the day.     On the weekend I usually don't have a lot going on other than working on homework and usually doing something with friends. Since I'm going into my junior year of high school, I'm pretty sure I'll have a lot of homework.     Most of my free time is pretty flexible aside from time I use to do schoolwork, and it's important to me that I'll still be able to do things with my friends even though I'll have a puppy.   It's possible that next year I'll join the Portrait Gallery's Teen Council, which meets on Wednesdays after school, but I'll need to see how this will fit into my schedule.     Other things possibly worth noting: The street I live on doesn't have sidewalks, but there are sidewalks a few blocks away.     "

We live in a single family home with a yard that is just about 1/4 acre and is fenced.  Our schedule is very flexible. We have just a Bernese Mtn Dog. (no other animals.) But we live close to the boarding school where we worked for 40 years and which has a campus of 125 acres and where there are many opportunities for socialization - people, facilities and other dogs to name some of the facets of the community that helped us as we raised our first 8 GEB pups. We do have volunteer jobs. I am a ""head start trainer"" at the Potter Animal Shelter in Portsmouth, RI. I spend 4 hours on Wednesdays working with their dogs, specifically. Steve is very conscious of the role he will play as co-puppy raiser. He works more flexible hours for Clean Ocean Access and Aquidneck Island Land Trust.  We are inclined to spend a few days at a time at a cottage on a lake in Vermont during the summer. The dogs would come with us.   Altho not familiar with the STEP approach, I am very comfortable with the positive reinforcement and the relationship-based approach of STEP.   I am not a speedy one but I do tend to jog 3+ miles multiple times per week. I do not, however, jog in the heat so I hope we might start a pup soon and i can replace my jogging with various puppy outings.   The distance to our puppy meetings is longer than I've managed in the past and we have just one car. I will do everything in my power to get to every puppy meeting. "

I work at Melles Griot Optical company and our clean modern facility is only 7 miles from home. I wondered if sometime in the future, with your permission and training we could learn to use. Our two story elevator as a unique training opportunity if needed to compliment the many adverse (while safe) training scenarios required in the life of a Guiding Eye Dog.  Our neighborhood provides paved bicycle paths with tunnels and ponds with geese off flying around with loud honking.  As our coTraining proceeds with walks in the shaded yard, I have seen little puppy cindy, sit and study the sights and sounds around our neighborhood often turning her head sideways in thought, as if rationalizing all her new world has to offer.  It's a remarkable and truly and enlightening experience.   I am looking forward to learning more about Guiding Eyes, and can't thank you enough for all you (and people like Cindy Chait) have given of their time and energy.  Thank you. Greg Hewitt"

I try and maintain a very structured schedule, even waking up early on weekends and going to bed around the same time as during the week.    Back to my typical work-day however, I feel that I am flexible in the morning as I am a morning person. If I needed to wake up earlier that wouldn't be a problem, even if it was early enough to add a walk, that wouldn't make much difference to me.

I prefer to fill my evenings, and that is typically flexible and would be quite adaptable to a puppy's needs I expect.

I have a housemate now who's retired - an adopted grandpa of sorts - who is willing to provide help when I cannot. We live in a house in the city, no fence around the yard. Weekends are similar: I like to fill them up, but I can easily envision adaptation for a puppy's presence and training. I do expect to get married in the not-so-distant future (within a year or so...), and that would involve a move and a new schedule.

My schedule changes from day to day. We have no children, only pets, a cat and a released GEB dog (Robby 3RR09) who I raised the RCT way and who is a registered therapy dog. If I take on the responsibility of raising, I fully understand and appreciate what is involved and will do what is expected of me. I am passionate about early socialization, am active in my community and use R+ methods. I don't have a preference about a shy vs bold puppy. I would consider myself a very experienced trainer and knowledgeable about canine learning theory, regularly attend conferences and webinars, and hope to enhance the puppy program as a raiser/trainer. I am currently studying for my CPDT test, and would love to be part of the GEB Capital NY team again. My lifestyle is fairly routine, work during the day, teach a few nights a week, spend time with my husband and dog. We enjoy hiking in the nature trails in our suburb and doing community visits. I often take my dog to school when I'm teaching so that might be a possibility for the puppy as well. I have fostered dogs for my local shelter and my dog Robby is very tolerant of other dogs and has a very high puppy tolerance and will give puppy license. I hope that is enough detail.

This time, the ""novel"" was written in Word and copied into this window...hope it works!cd  Upon reading about ""us"" below, one might think we're too busy to raise a pup.  Truth is, we are busy, but see ourselves transitioning into retirement, along with the freedom to choose our activities and create our own schedule.  I've already begun downsizing my commitments to the not-for-profit organizations I work with, which means no 911 night duty, less travel, and fewer committee meetings.  I prepare much of my work at home, and my onsite volunteer work and travel averages 40 hours a month.  For most of our lives, my husband and I have managed to ""tag team"", meaning that one of us was at home when kids were, and now one of us is usually home to take care of farm animals.    As for matching with a GEB pup or other opportunity,  I feel I am most flexible and would be the prime raiser.  My husband John probably can not attend many classes, but will review any resources and follow the ""GEB-way"" of meeting pup needs, leading, rewarding and caring for a puppy/dog.  We're both healthy and active.  My only complaint is some lack of range of motion with my right arm, but I managed pretty well with the left!  We‚Äôve no preference about breed or gender.    Lifestyle: 60+ couple, living in rural environment , known as the Northeast Kingdom of VT.  John manages the forest (heat with wood, and makes maple syrup).  In summer he grows vegetables, raises the 2 beef cows, chickens and 3 piglets-all of which feeds our extended family/friends.  The fields are maintained by a local farmer.  Most of our family lives in the Boston, Cambridge, Cape Cod area, and we travel to the city and beach several times a year.    We do have lots of diverse company ‚Äì for dinner or extended stays in our guest apartment.  The few dogs who come with their owners are small and well ‚Äìmannered.  We both rise early (5am-ish) each day and go to bed after 11pm or midnight.  Evenings for John, usually involves making dinner (I clean up) and he most always watches a movie.  We have no television.  I enjoy piano, crafts, reading, and coffee with two neighbors once a week, when possible.  Summer plans are to work on the gardens and prepare for a June cousins reunion in Mass and our daughter‚Äôs wedding at our Vermont home.    John retires from his position as professor at a local college this spring, and will continue on a part-time basis in the GIS mapping lab.   He is known as ""20-mule team John"" because he has so many talents, interests, hobbies and skills (i.e. fixing things, cooking, mountaineering, fishing and rod-building, logging, homebuilding and repairing, inventing, gardening, Spanish...to name a few).      We have two amazing 'kids' both under 30: Christine lives in Montpelier, VT and is a 1st year science teacher for grades 7-11 in Bethel.  She'll marry wonderful Bob this August at our home.

When Chris and Dan were in middle/high school we raised Rita and Rika for GEB , along with swapping with other Vermont raisers....all good memories.

Since retiring 3 years ago as Dept Chair and Prof of the Mountain Recreation program at a local college, I have devoted much of my time in service to organizations with which I have been connected for many years:    ‚Ä¢	Lyndon Rescue Squad (EMT- I am on limited active duty because of a back/shoulder injury and do monthly psa's  for local media);  ‚Ä¢	MCWglobal.org -an inspirational international youth leadership organization (advisor, my travel to NYC will be  reduced to a few days this summer);  ‚Ä¢	NEK Habitat for Humanity (Steering, PR and Family support committees);  ‚Ä¢	Daniel Webster Estate (Docent on  1st Sundays June thru Dec -in Marshfield, MA).    Too much info, perhaps?  I can only imagine how a newly arrived pup would view his or her new environment here‚Äì so very different from his birthplace.  No other dogs or pets, but lots of natural sounds and sites.  On any one evening, languages over the dinner table may range from Chinese to Arabic, Swahili or Spanish, as we host visitors from many corners of the world.  We hope to be worthy hosts for a curious, confident and trusted canine.  If accepted, we look forward to the challenge.  Thank you for your consideration.   John and Cathy DeLeo  "
164, ,0,0,Maine,,,,04/20/15,During the school year I have classes but fortunately my schedule for next semester does not have long periods that I will be away. Since I am on campus I will always be close enough by that I could stop to check in on the pup. So I will be able to take the dog out to go the bathroom throughout the day and have longer periods where I could take the puppy for a walk. The only time I would be busy for up to three hours would be when I am working and it is the kind of job where I would not be able to take care of the puppy at that time. On the weekends I am pretty free and either work on homework or go out and do things outside. So the pup could be my companion that entire time.
165, ,0,0,Maine,,,,04/20/15,My typical week is going to an assortment of classes but having time in between each class to go back to the room before the next class. In the time that I'm not in class I work 20 hrs a week in the cafeteria but usually only three days a week doing 7 to 8 hours. My weekends are usually focused around being at the college. I don't go home often because I can't afford to drive home all the time. In the fall I may go out hunting on saturday morning but Sundays are usually homework days. 
166, ,0,0,Maine,,,,04/20/15,"While at school (Fall):  I have classes five days a week. Most teachers will be fine with a puppy in class. I have 4 roommates who are very excited for the puppy. Class schedules are not flexible, but are spaced out well to take the pup out. Weekends are usually free. My suite is on the first floor. I go to school in Maine, but live in Mass so 3 hour drives may be necessary. I am willing to stop for the pup to ""get busy"" on these rides. The pup will be around a lot of people since I am on campus.    At Home (Summer):  I work at a park that will likely be from Sunday-Thursday (subject to change). I have classes Tuesday and Thursday nights from 6-10pm. I am not sure if the pup will be allowed in these classes. I live in a house in a suburb that allows lots of noise for the pup to get used to as well as quieter, more forested park areas. My mom, dad, and brother live with me and they are also very excited for the pup.

I am usually out of the house three mornings per week from 9 until noon but can be flexible the rest of the time. Our weekends are flexible as needed. My children have their own homes so it is just my husband and I. Our eldest son is getting married in November, so no grandchildren yet. We are dog lovers and were privileged to have two wonderful Labrador Retrievers in our life. Now that we have no pets, being a sitter for the puppy raisers in the area seems to be a good choice for me at this time. I am planning on being an active back-up for my neighbor Pat Carforo who will be a first time raiser shortly, but I know that there is a need for sitters so I am offering my time for other raisers as well.

However I do not work the summer semester.  I own a dog, who is a ""Buzz"" dog with lineage to guiding eyes. However my dog grew up in the Puppy Behind Bars program when guiding eyes and PBB were connected. I do daily/every other day visits with my dog who is a Therapy dog to Ronald McDonald House, or a senior living facility, or  a classroom, a library or a local hospitals. My therapy dog, MayLa, will be 11 next month.(Please consider this when placing a dog with me.)  She is extraordinary at what she does and I am lucky to be on the other end of the leash. We walk daily. I do early home socialization for guiding eyes and  she has been wonderful with the puppies. (Cute pictures to share if interested.)   I spend a great deal of time on Long Island with my 91 year old mother. She has a fenced in yard for the dog to play in. She also has my cat who keeps her company since my father died five years ago. At times my cat lives with me. My cat loves dogs - often i find her cleaning my dog's ears and then my dog will clean hers. (Cute videos to share if you are ever interested.) Often at my mother's house my sister will visit with dogs she is socializing from the PBB program. She gets dogs about once a month.     I am excited to share this opportunity with Sherry Washauer because of her expertise and love of dogs. We met through dog volunteer work. "

We have a 4 year old pure bred Yellow Labrador Retriever named Crosby who we have had since he was 8 weeks old.  I loved training Crosby as a puppy.  He is a Therapy dog that goes weekly to Women's and Children's Hospital to visit patients, patient families, and staff.  He also is a Canine Good Citizen.  Boy do I miss puppy breath although we love Crosby as if he were human (although Crosby is not allowed upstairs or in our family room in our house).      I am a High School/Middle School Librarian.  My husband works out of the house so he is available to relieve the dog during the day when I am at work.  He is self-employed in the stand-by generator sales and installation business for Lowes.  He also loves large dogs, especially retrievers.  I am off for the summer at the end of June, thus why I have requested a puppy at that time, when I can devote all of my energy to raising him/her.  I am very flexible in the summer.    I do not like German Shepherds, but love both Golden and Labrador Retrievers.  I will take male or female, although I have a strong liking to the males.  I am also a little concerned about the females being in heat in my home.  I have been considering volunteering as a puppy raiser for years, and now that all three of my children are in college, I would like to give back by raising a puppy for GEB.  In the summer all five family members will be at home, but come fall only three of us will be home to take care of the puppy.    I am excited for the challenge and fun of raising another puppy for such a worthwhile cause.  Thank-you for such a wonderful opportunity, and for providing this so neede service to the blind, and kids with autism.  By the way I love the wrapping paper that you send to people who make donations to GEB, I want more!  Where do I buy it?    Thank-you,  Colleen    "

178, ,0,0,Delmarva,,,,04/13/15,"My typical days and lifestyle.  I am a mechanic by trade and for a living.  I began as an Auto Mechanic, than went into the marine industry, and now I am in the Aircraft industry.  In these fields the majority of my work is mobile and local, (I mostly work for myself).  My passion is with the marine industry; Which is where I spend most of my time.  Outdoors on the go, meeting, greeting, and helping other people.  These are the things that keep me happy, healthy, and outgoing.  I enjoy boating and fishing as my favorite free pass times.  I am a born and raised local here on Kent Island.  As a kid my father raised turkeys.  One year just before slotter time, my  2 year older sister and I got our first dog.  She was a mixed breed of some sorts.  We named her Lassey.  Together we learned responsibilities and some basic training.  When I was 13, my mom sis and I went on vacation (to Fla to visit grandma).  While we were away dad had to take the dog to the vet and have her put to rest (she couldn't get around any longer).  At the age of 14, I came across a shepard/beagle mix puppy.  I named her Angel.  It took a few days to convince my father to let me get a dog.  I promised to take full responsibility, care, training, shelter, and all cost associated with the pet.  When he agreed, he said it was to be an outdoor pet only.  Right away, I gathered materials and supplies to construct her a 40' x 40' chain link fenced area within our wooded yard.  I built her a deluxe dog house, 2 rooms, insulated, heated, with a shingled roof, and siding to match the house.  I also included a rain gutter, and front porch (to keep the food and water bowls out of the weather).  Daily care was feed, water, and play with dog before going to school.  I'd walk to work from school and work till 5pm, than mom would pick me up (home a few minutes after 5).  Home for the evening; feed, water, play, and train with the dog.  After work the dog would spend all of her time with me in all my events (no longer contained. Only bound by command).  It didn't take long.  Dad was happy with my show of responsibility, and ttraining.  He than made her a place in the attached garage with a way for her to enter and exit as she pleased and necessary (she became a great watch dog).    After getting my liscense at 16, already having a vehicl; after school I'd rush home to get her, take her to work with me, and everywhere from there.  At 18 I moved out and took her with me.  Already being trained, she than became an indoor pet for the rest of her life.  After graduating she was by my side with me all hours of the day and her life.  No matter where I lived or worked the dog was always welcome and there.  She didn't even mind living on the boat with me in her later years.  She lived to be 15 an 1/2 years old.  In her last year an half she was able to help me train my new rescue Isabelle.  Isabelle was born 3/28/2002.  Records show I am the fourth owner of the dog.  I rescued her in 4/2003 (from a friends girlfriend about to be returned to the pound).  She was very malnurished, disobedient, and uncontrollable.  She didn't even really recognize her name.  All she needed was a good diet, love, care, and guidence.  Within a few weeks she was living on the boat with Angel an I, with no fear of her running off, falling over, chewing, or messing in the boat.  After spaying and recieving her papers, I found she is a pure bred Doberman Pincher (Fawn in color), with a traceable madam and sire.  The name on the papers that she was given from birth was ""Daddy's Girl Isabelle"" so there she is a perfect name for such a wonderful/beautiful dog in such a situation.  She goes everywhere with me and is always by myside or within comand distance.   People ask her where I am, and ask me where she is , if not at my side.  All of my job careers and posistions have allowed me to have her by myside.  She is well manard and respected, and has always been wecome in the office or on the jobsite.  These days she is alot older and moving slower.  She doesn't get out as much, or go as many places, but still shares alot of quality time with me; daily.  My flexable schedual allows me to check and care for her frequently throughout the day.  These days I usally don't go out of barking range, in case she needs help.  We live in a 3 bedroom, 2 bath rancher with a large wooded back yard (which I purchased 10 years ago).  We have a small sidewalk, a gravel driveway, a large deck with a few steps, and hardwood floors in the house.  A few throw rugs, and a ramp down the back steps help Isabelle move about better.  I am single, never been married, and no children.  Isabelle is my girl.  We have a roomate who is rearly around.  I believe a guiding eyes pup will be a great way to help ease the pain, and educate me and further my training methods.  I will also be satisied I was able to raise such an important animal for a visually impared person.  I am an eager outgoing social butterfly.  I hate being home or indoors for long periods of time.  I look forward to raising a pup, and thank you for your time in reviewing me as a pup raiser."

We enjoy visiting the local towns which would be a great experience for a future guide dog.  Our one daughter lives in Pa.  They have an adopted dog from the Guide Dog Foundation of Smithton LI.  He was released from the program due to dog distraction.  He is 12 years old and in perfect health.  His issue with dog disraction has diminished and in every other aspect would be a great role model.      Our other daughter lives in Nassau county NY.  Visits there would expose a puppy to a 5 and 7 year old as well as to more street and vehicle sounds.    We do take a trip to visit our son in Florida during the winter.  2-6 weeks    I volunteer in a thrift store once a week for 3 hours.

On the weekends, I like to sleep in until 7:00 AM.  I usually go for a short jog either Saturday or Sunday morning. (Only one mile).  I have breakfast with my husband, and then I pay bills, make a grocery list, run errands (clothes to the drycleaners.)  On Sundays, we usually just relax.  We will either visit family, go for a walk in the park, or go shopping.  Then we prepare for the work week.  (Plan and possibly prepare meals).  When the weather is nice, we will spend the weekends outside, gardening, weeding, etc.  Monday through Thursday is somewhat flexible, but Thursday through Sunday is very flexible.

We do not have children at home, and we do not have any pets, except for a neighbor cat who likes to come around for kitty treats!  We do go on vacation twice a year, usually for one week, but sometimes for two weeks.  We are not expecting any major life changes.  I would love to be a co-raiser, as I would be able to have a puppy from Thursday through Sunday.  If not, then I would be able to be a sitter.

192, ,0,0,Eastern MA,,,,03/20/15,"I live in Groton, MA, in a home with my husband Chris, and my daughters Mae (16) and Amelia (13). We have a 10 year-old black lab mix Jack, a 9 year-old cat Shadow, and a flock of chickens in a coop. Our home is on a relatively quiet road, in a neighborhood with other houses, with sidewalks nearby. We have a lot of dogs on the street that regularly walk or run by with their owners. We live on about an acre of land, and have a small pond, a meadow, and woods behind us. We often walk to Lawrence Academy nearby, where there are soccer and lacrosse fields.    I run with my dog every morning, and walk him again once or twice in the afternoon. We are an active family, and enjoy playing with Jack with tennis balls in the snow and playing tug of war with a rope. He went to obedience classes as a pup, and we love him to pieces. We are completely open to any training methods proposed and taught by GEB, and are humble and know we have a lot to learn.    Our cat shadow is tolerant of Jack, and bats at him gently if he gets very close.    My work schedule is as follows:    Monday 8:30am-2:15pm, Tuesday 1:30pm-5:00pm, Wednesday 8:30am-12:00pm, Thurs 8:30-12:00pm, and Friday 8:30am-5:00pm. I am a physician and see patients in the office during those hours, but have flexibility if needed. I am occasionally on call on a Saturday morning, about once every 3 months, but otherwise am home all weekend. I have 8 weeks of vacation a year, spread out over the year. Some afternoons are spent driving to the kids‚Äô activities, such as math class, track practice, and soccer games. We have traveled a lot over the past 10 years, but I am ready to stay put for a while. We have a summer house in Chatham, and we like going on hikes, riding in our boat, swimming in ponds, and walking around the town.    My husband Chris is a cabinetmaker, and he has his shop on our property. He is home much of the time, and is willing and excited to help with puppy care. Everyone is on board in terms of consistency and house manners, and we have discussed this over many dinners and walks over the past months.     We are hoping that Mae can be the primary raiser, and I will be the secondary raiser. I know that typically raisers are 18 years and older, but Mae is very responsible, an honors student who sees the big responsibility ahead and has planned accordingly. She will be very available to raise the puppy. Please see her survey for details of her plans. Basically, Mae will be out of school for the summer in mid-June. At that time, she will have very little scheduled other than an SAT prep course and an occasional art class. She plans to spend her time devoted to GEB, training, raising, exercising and socializing the puppy. In the fall and winter of 2015-2016, Mae is planning not to play sports, and instead focus on puppy raising and training. My schedule will continue as usual.     In May, Mae will be in school during the day and in track practice in the afternoon. While I am at work, Chris will take care of the puppy‚Äôs needs such as being fed, going outside, etc. When I get home (a little after noon M, W, Th), I will take over the puppy care. On Tuesday mornings, I am home and will care for the pup, and Chris will take over any care on Tuesday afternoons. On Fridays, Chris will take care of the pup‚Äôs needs. I am hoping to plan some vacation days during May in order to facilitate my involvement, especially until Mae is more available.    As soon as track ends at the end of May, Mae will be home by 2:00 every day, and can be in charge of puppy care, socialization and training. We are excited to work with the pup in a variety of settings, including meeting with other GEB trainers, meeting other people, and going to public places as the pup is ready. Our family recognizes the major commitment of time, energy, patience, and humility and is eager to embark on this new adventure. We are hoping that this becomes a longterm opportunity, as we would love to be repeat raisers over time, giving our energy to a wonderful cause. Thanks so much for considering us. "

202, ,0,0,Lower Westchester,,,,02/20/15,"I feel that I will be better able to answer this question in much more detail when I figure out my life a little better. At this point I know that my life, living situation, and work schedule are not suited for a puppy. I would like to be able to puppy sit an older pup if the situation arises, as I am allowed to have a dog in my office. I currently take my 5 year old german shepherd to the office a few times a week, and the office is open to having dogs. However I am currently looking for a new job and a new apartment and I know that I cannot at this point bring a puppy into my life. Everything about my life is flexible and I would be able to accommodate a pup for a short period of time at this point, though I think a week or less would be preferable. I currently have a cat, a dog, and a husband, and live in a small apartment, but at this very moment in time the cat, husband, and apartment are all iffy. The German Shepherd is constant, she will be staying a number of years yet as she is only 5. Re reading this I know it makes me sound like I am the exact opposite of an idea raiser, which is why I know that I cannot raise at this point, but still want to be involved, and once I figure out my life and living situation be able to someday raise.     I am 28 currently living with my husband although we are discussing separation, so who knows where that is going. I have raised 2 pups for The Seeing Eye, one who is currently a narcotics detective, and the 5 year old that is currently living with me. She was released due to a low hip score. I currently work at The Performing Arts Center at Purchase College. I have a degree in theatre from Rutgers University, which is also the club with which I raised my first pup. So I am involved in the arts and enjoy musicals. Currently my weekends alternate between hanging around at home and taking Kara hiking. I have always enjoyed the weekend socialization outings that I attended with previous puppy clubs as well as individual socialization outings - I enjoyed being out and about with my pups so I am really looking forward to puppy centered group activities.

KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL, AUSTIN LEAVES AT 7, SOFIA LEAVES 8:45  I LEAVE FOR WORK AT 8 WITH DAISY, MY 7year old YELLOW LAB EACH DAY.  I WORK IN MAMARONECK SO SHE WALKS THE STREETS WITH ME and IS A GREAT OFFICE DOG.  GREETS VISITORS NICELY, DOESN'T GET INTO THE GARBAGE, FINDS ALL THE NICE SUN SPOTS TO LAY IN, ETC.    I DRIVE HOME WITH DAISY EACH DAY TO WORK.  DAISY IS A SWEET, SUBMISSIVE LAB, VERY FRIENDLY TO ALL.  GREAT WITH PEOPLE AND DOGS.    WE GOT HER FROM KEE-PIN LABS, A BREEDER OUTSIDE OF ALBANY.  WE TRAINED HER WELL, CRATED HER,  NO FURNITURE EVER, CAREFUL WITH TREATS, NO BEGGING, NO PEOPLE FOOD, EVERYONE USES THE SAME COMMANDS, ETC.  SHE IS A BIG PART OF OUR LIVES.    SOMETIMES DAISY STAYS HOME AND IS ALONE FROM 8:45-2:20 WHEN AUSTIN GETS HOME.  SHE ROAMS THE HOUSE, WELL BEHAVED.  AUSTIN TAKES HER OUT. SOFIA GETS HOME AT 4:30.  PLAYS WITH DAISY, HAS A SNACK, DOES HOMEWORK.    I GET HOME AT 6.  DINNER GETS STARTED.  DAISY EATS AT 6:30.  SOME NIGHTS WE RUN ERRANDS, GO TO PRACTICE, PICK UP AUSTIN FROM WORK AT STOP & SHOP.  KIDS HAVE DINNER WITH THEIR DAD ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK.    WEEKENDS - SAT AM IS CLEANING TIME.  BIRTHDAY PARTIES SOMETIMES.  SUNDAY IS CHURCH FROM 9-11.   CHEER FROM 3-8PM.  SOME SATURDAYS WE HAVE COMPETITIONS SO WE ARE OUT EARLY AM - EARLY AFTERNOON.  IN THE WINTER WE SOMETIMES SKI- IF GONE ALL DAY, A NEIGHBOR COMES TO PLAY AND LET DAISY OUT SO SHE ISNT ALONE ALL DAY.  CHEER COMPETITION SEASON IS JAN-APRIL.  IF I WERE A FULL TIME RAISER, I MIGHT NEED HELP ON A COUPLE WEEKENDS- A SITTER.  SOMETIMES I TRAVEL TO FL.  MY 98 YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER LIVES THERE AS WELL AS MY DAD AND STEP MOM.  I BRING THE KIDS.  DAISY STAYS WITH A FRIEND OR I HAVE SOMEONE COME STAY AT THE HOUSE.    ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS OF COURSE WILL BE MY BOSS ALLOWING ME TO BRING A PUPPY TO WORK EACH DAY.  MIND YOU THIS MAN HAS A LAB PUPPY CALENDAR OF HIS DESK AND OOOHS AND AAAHS AT EACH DAYS PHOTO, BUT ITS STILL A BIG DEAL.  HE LIKES THE IDEA OF MY DOG THERE NOW BECAUSE HE GETS THE PLEASURE OF HER COMPANY WITHOUT ANY FUSS.  LIKE A GRANDPARENT, HE SAYS.      WE WERE THINKING OF SITTING FIRST TO SEE THE DEMANDS OF PUPPY RAISING.  AUSTIN AND SOFIA BOTH LIKE THE IDEA OF SITTING TO EASE INTO FULL TIME RAISING.  I THINK THE KIDS TAKE DAISY FOR GRANTED IN A WAY AND FORGET THAT PUPPIES REQUIRE PRACTICALLY EVERY MOMENT OF YOUR ATTENTION.  THEY NEED TO BE ON BOARD AS I WILL NEED THEIR HELP FOR SURE!    IF SITTING WERE NOT AN OPTION AND WE COULD PUPPY RAISE, THE BEST TIMING WOULD PROBABLY BE AUGUST AFTER SUMMER VACATION (BEACH VACATION-DAISY TOO- IN DELAWARE) AND WITH MY BOSSES BLESSING OF COURSE.  ANOTHER OPTION WE WOULD EXPLORE WOULD BE 'SHARING THE PUPPY RAISING' WITH ANOTHER FAMILY.  DEFINATELY INTERESTED IN HOW THAT MIGHT WORK. (START A PUPPY, OLDER PUPPY)    AUSTIN IN A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, SOFIA IS IN 6TH GRADE.  BOTH HAVE ATTENDED THE TRAINING SESSIONS WITH ME.  THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT TRAINERS TO DAISY IN TERMS OF CONSISTENCY AND I KNOW THEY WOULD BE LOVING RAISERS TOO.  AND ME? FORGET ABOUT IT.  I CRY AT EACH GRADUATION CEREMONY I WATCH ON YOU TUBE OR WHEN I WENT THERE IN JANUARY WITH SOFIA.  ITS SUCH AN AMAZING GIFT- WHEN YOU SEE THE DOGS WITH THEIR BLIND OWNERS.  THE PLEASURE IS OURS TO HELP GET THEM READY FOR THAT.                              "

206, ,0,0,South Western CT,,,,02/19/15,"Monday through Friday I work from 8am - 5pm. I leave my house in Fairfield around 7:30am and commute 30 minutes to my office in Westport. I have my own office at work (I might need to move out of it). My office is on the second floor and there is no elevator in the building (the dog will have to walk up the stairs/be carried when a puppy). The office environment I work in is very hectic and loud, there is a large customer service call center right outside my office with 6 people talking on the phone all day,  a lot of phones ringing, people running around etc. I do quite a bit of going downstairs and back upstairs during my day so I come in and out of my office a lot as well as a lot of people come in and out. At around noon - 1pm, I drive 5 minutes to my parents house to have lunch for about an hour, there may be a Newfoundland puppy in that house coming in the next couple of months. I return to the office and then leave around 5pm and get home around 5:45 pm. I sometimes stay later for meetings. I also go to the gym twice a week directly after work in Westport.    I live in a house in Fairfield with a roommate. I have the master bedroom, a guest bedroom and a bathroom on the second floor to myself. This is where the dog would sleep, the stairs are pretty steep. My roommate has a small dog, a maltese. It goes with her everywhere. She gets home around 7pm every night during the week so that is when her dog arrives as well. Her dog does not go upstairs, only on the first floor and is mostly attached to her, even around the house. He is a friendly dog but barks a lot. He is crate trained and is not let outside unattended. He also is not trained at all in terms of knowing basic commands. I have a .25 acres, not fenced in back yard. My neighborhood has a lot of sidewalks, a park down the street.    On most weekends, I go up to a family house in New Hampshire. I usually leave after work on Friday, it is a 2.5 hour drive. The house is on a lake, there is no fenced in area. My sister has a 8 month old chocolate lab that is at the home on most weekends. On weekends that I am not in New Hampshire, I am running errands around Fairfield and Westport during the day/doing house work/yard work."

A puppy could be with me during this time, but I would not have much free time to take him/her outside or play.  On Monday nights, I generally go to puppy classes regardless.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have class from 10:10- 2:40.  I would be more than willing to bring my puppy to classes with me.  I would be free to pick him/her up before class and return him/her to the raiser afterward.  I generally go to the gym right after classes on T/R.  I have a meeting 7-8 on Tuesdays but am generally free otherwise.  On Wednesdays, I have class from 12:20-2:15 and 2:55-4:10.  Again, I could bring the puppy to these classes with me and am flexible before and after for pick up/ drop off.  I usually exercise after class on this day as well.  On Fridays, I have class from 1:25-2:15.  I then usually go to the library to do work until about 5.  I could bring the puppy to class on Fridays with me but this day is not as ideal as Tuesday-Wednesday.  On weekdays, I eat dinner at the sorority house that I live in.  The house would not have a problem with having a dog, and my housemates would be very friendly and love to play with the puppy.  On weekends, I am usually free on Saturday and Sunday afternoons after 12 and before 5:30.  I would be willing to take the puppy at those times and hang out at the house or walk around and play.  I am very easygoing and would love to sit for any type of puppy at all!  I would love to have a weekly schedule or just sit at random times.  I just want the opportunity to sit for a puppy!"

After the first preparation day, the rest of the week I put in hours collecting data from these preparations.

I will also be one of a team - supporting my wife Carol who is the primary trainer. I will get up in the nite to let the dog out to do his business. I will be the one who walks the dog at the end of the day and participates in the training when the dog is with me before work, after work and on weekends.  The puppy can join me at work for some time and socialize with people and dogs in the village of Katonah.  I love dogs, grew up with them and have had a dog for all of the time we have had children - which is over the last 29 years.

I also do not have a car on campus. I am here at school pretty much whenever classes are in session, and during those periods of time I do spend most of my time going to classes, studying, or in meetings. I have no qualms about being up very early (I'm usually asleep before 11 anyway), and there's a ton of walking already incorporated into my day so exercising a dog would not be a problem.

I have flexibility in the time I arrive at work and the time I can leave.

I have permission from my principal to have a Guiding Eyes Puppy visit my class at school on a weekly basis, and we are looking into permission from the district for longer periods of time (if I were to become a raiser the puppy and his/her crate would come to school with me).

220, ,0,0,Monroe,,,,01/28/15,"I am 70 years old and retired.  I don't really have a schedule to keep except for some doctor and dentist appointments.  I volunteer 2 to 3 hours each Monday morning at my church.  I am in good health but I do have arthritis so I am stiff in the morning and move a little slowly until I can get the joints working.  I do not like to go for walks outside in the winter any more because I am afraid of slipping and falling.  My daughter works but is very willing to help out with a puppy when she is available.  My husband won't be real involved in any training.  They know they have to follow the policies of Guiding Eyes with regard to the puppy and are willing to do that.  I have three grandchildren - 2 in Florida and 1 in Massachusetts.  I get called away from time to time to babysit when their parents need a babysitter in an emergency.  At those times I have immediately flown out to get there to help.  I live in a house in a residential neighborhood and have a neighbor who is more than willing to help out puppy sitting.  She did it for us for many years for our own dog who is now in doggy heaven.  Since we are retired, my husband and I like to do some traveling and we have planned a trip to South Dakota to visit friends and to Disney World for a family vacation.  We are also hoping to go the United Kingdom.    From experience I know it is a big commitment of time and energy to properly raise a puppy who will be your pet.  But from the material I have read and the information presented at the first Pre-Placement class, it is an even bigger commitment to properly raise a Guiding Eyes puppy.  I feel I would be better suited to be a puppy sitter, if you would have me, than take on a year and a half commitment to be a puppy raiser.  My family and I would have no problem with sitting a puppy for a weekend or one or two weeks or even a month.  I think it would be fun and a great way to play some role in a puppy's journey to becoming a guide dog."

226, ,0,0,Maine,,,,01/24/15,"I am a Catholic priest, currently serving as the Superintendent of Maine Catholic Schools and also involved in weekend parish ministry.  I live alone in a rectory in a suburban setting that is attached to a church and parish center (parish hall, classrooms and offices).  What prompted me to explore GEB was the death of my 17-year-old dog this past December--the rectory feels very empty to me, but for a variety of reasons (particularly the fact that I'll be 77 if my next dog should live to be 17), I don't feel that I'm prepared at this time for a ""forever dog"" in my life.  The 18-or-so month commitment sounds like a perfect match, and I welcome the opportunity to do some meaningful volunteer work outside of the Church (it's hard to volunteer for an organization that pays your salary).  I remember well the work and commitment involved in raising a puppy--although it was 17 years ago, I had Baxter since he was 8 weeks old.  He adapted well to rectory living--there have been several different rectories in Maine, and Baxter adjusted to the move better than me.    So, I don't have a family, but I am surrounded by staff that are dog-friendly people and supportive.  And when I am in the rectory, there is no one else around to compete for my attention--it's all focused on the dog, or at least it was with Baxter.  I spend a few hours each week in our central office in Portland, visit our 13 schools on a regular basis, and do a couple of weekend Masses here at the Church.  I work a lot ""from home"" via computer.   The puppy would be able to accompany me on many of these ""excursions,"" and so I think my life-style would provide plenty of different socialization experiences (at least the dog will learn how to behave in school and in church!).  I spend my day off with overnight or two almost every week at my ""camp"" (a year-round house--but in Maine, we call our get-aways ""camps"") that will someday be my retirement home, located on Tilton Pond about 90 minutes from the rectory in Gorham.  Baxter loved the pond--I think it would provide another whole set of experiences for the GEB puppy balancing a rural, country setting with the more suburban setting of the Gorham rectory.  I could also provide plenty of city experiences for the puppy in Portland where I have my office--ten minutes away from Gorham.  The Gorham fire station is right across the street from the rectory--the puppy will certainly be used to sirens, flashing lights, and fire trucks by the time he moves on from here.  There is also school across the street with fields and access to miles of walking/cross-country skiing trails that are popular with dog-walkers.    If all goes according the plan, we will find a permanent lay superintendent of schools and I would return to full-time parish ministry, most likely right where I am now in Gorham.  That would serve to increase my flexibility.   If there is a change in assignment, the rectory situation would be very similar to what is described above and would be relatively close to where I am now living--mid-coast or Southern Maine).    I am going to be travelling to Europe for two weeks beginning in mid-August--only extended travel plans that I have.      Hope this is helpful.    Lou Phillips"

I work until about 9:00 then either go to the Y or come home.  I usually take Sammy for a walk at some point before I leave again for my afternoon shift at 12:45.  This time frame is when I'll have some alone time to get training in or take additional walks.  I am currently out of work due to a leg surgery in Dec. that has left me with nerve damage.  So far I haven't been able to get back to my usual routine for exercise or walks.  I'm hoping by spring that changes.  My norm when I get back to work would be going in for my afternoon shift at 1:00.  I get out again about 4:30 and come home.  My twins Nicki & Lauren (13 yrs. old) get home at 4:15 and let out Sammy, and would be happy to have a puppy to take out.  They are very excited to do this training with me.  I get home anywhere from 4:45- 5:00 and depending on what activities we have my daughters in at the time dictates the rest of the evening.  Currently only Nicki has Tues evening practice so the rest of the evenings are free for more walks training etc.  I have 2 older daughters in college so they are not always around.  We will go over all the training with them to be consistent and they both love dogs so there will be a lot of playtime around here.  I am off for all the school breaks and summer.  Weekends just depend on the kids activities usually in and out of the house, sometimes just laying around the house.  The spring break would probably be the best time for our 3 day puppy stay, this way I don't have to worry about losing sleep if the puppy is anxious.  My house is in a development we have a little over an acre.  My dog is on an invisible fence so we'll use the lead when taking the puppy out.  We have a pool that is fenced in, we let Sammy swim on occasion depending on time frame (he has golden long hair and needs bath after swimming).

I have siblings that have dogs, so the puppy would get a lot of socialization and play time. He or she would by the only animal in my house so there is a lot of time for training and bonding between the puppy and myself. I think it would be a great place for a difficult puppy. There are no distractions and if they seem like they need to play, my siblings all have fenced in back yards with dogs that can be play buddies. During the weekend I like to go to my moms house. We have a small farm so I go up there to ride horses and do farm chores. The puppy would get great experience to other animals. I would love to be a puppy raiser again, but would like to start out as a sitter first to get my feet wet again. But if there is a puppy that needs a raiser and there is none, I am more than happy to set up to the plate!"

Other information you should know about me is that I have a female black lab, but she is very welcoming and playful. However reading your expectations or your guiding eye dogs; my dog doesn't have the same standards, but then again she is not a guiding eyes dog. My backyard is fence, and I let my dog is let out frequently. When she wants to play, and to use the bathroom. We do not have a command for her to use the bathroom but we do have basic commands, that every dog should know. Therefore, I do not take my dog on walks often because she gets her exercise everyday running and playing in the backyard; but whenever in free I will try to. This will not be an issue for me to walk a guiding eyes dog for the reason being, your rules state other wise. My dog is every well trained and is able to be walked without a leash!

We lost our 12 year old dog a year ago.  My parents have raised a GEB dog (when I was in college) and it was a tremendous experience for them.  I am excited to learn about helping to raise a dog in a positive, playful manner (just as I believe human parents should raise their own children) and to learn to give to others in a meaningful way.  We live in a single family home in a safe neighborhood and have been here in Merrimack for 10 years.  My husband, Chris works full time in Lowell, sometimes from home, with travel involved in his work (which varies from a day to a week at a time).  I work part time 15-20 hours a week with a flexible schedule.  I am self-employed and contract to the school system 15 minutes from our home.  I would be able to come home during the day to let the dog out when needed.  The children attend school from 7-2:30.  Both kids are quite invested in raising the puppy, and Anna (12) is attending all of the puppy raiser classes with me.  We do a lot of activities around town (soccer, flag football, library, school activities) and it would be fun to bring the puppy with us when appropriate.  The kids and I have off in the summer and Chris has a more flexible schedule, so we like to travel in the summer.  We may take a 2-3 week trip, with some shorter trips planned as well.  We would need a puppy sitter to help out when we travel, but we'll know this ahead of time.  We are SO excited to become part of GEB...first as puppy sitters, then on to becoming puppy raisers!"
254, ,0,0,Lower Westchester,,,,11/25/14,"My typical weekday begins around 6:30am, getting ready to go to work. I commute to work out on Long Island from Astoria, Queens. I work a full time job and am out of the apartment from 6:30am to about 3 or 4pm. My lifestyle is fairly low key. Weeknights at home I usually involve things around the house ‚Äì doing chores, watching TV or a movie or spending some time each night down in the building‚Äôs exercise room. We live in an apartment building, a condominium which allows dogs. During the warmer months I may spend some free time across the street at the park or spending some time doing photography.   I also work a part time job, usually one night a week and a weekend day. On the weekends we may engage in a variety of activities, going to the movies or out to eat, in nicer weather going hiking or kayaking.  My weekday schedule can be somewhat flexible in the morning and afternoon. For example, it would be no problem if I had to go in late if Mayra had to leave earlier than I did, and the puppy needed to be walked. Also, in the afternoon I can leave work a little early if Mayra‚Äôs and my schedule do not overlap and someone needed to be home to walk and feed the puppy.   Our building is very dog friendly. We live on the second floor and have nice neighbors. I do not have any physical limitations, I can(and have) handle a puppy, a growing dog and a full grown dog. We do not have any other pets or children so we can devote more time to the puppy, and there will be less distractions. Our neighborhood is a typical quiet Queens neighborhood. Walking would be on the street, however there is a park across the street which allows dogs. There is no dog run or dog park, people are allowed to walk their dogs in the park. It‚Äôs a New York City park, which allows dogs provided they are kept on a leash. In an afternoon on a warmer day I might see one person with a dog in the park.   I have grown up with dogs (mostly Springer Spaniels) and am completely comfortable around them. I have experience with raising a large dog from a pup to full grown (my parents also had a very large Dalmatian). I have helped with feeding, walking, cleaning up and comforting them if they got sick, and bringing them to obedience class (though I understand that all training would follow Guiding Eyes training, not what I may have learned in the past).   We greatly admire the work done by Guiding Eyes and would give our best to raise a puppy properly so it may one day help another person."

There are 2 parks nearby.   I even asked at the library if I could bring a puppy in training and they said it is allowed (and only if permitted by Guiding Eyes and the region manager). I have seen other dogs in training around. I have no physical limitations and have no children or other animals.   Peter and I both love dogs and have a puppy safe and ready home.

While we are busy, over-extended at times with work, school, sports, religious and family obligations, we will give 100 percent to raising our puppy.  I, the mom, work full time but close to home at Metro- North Railroad in Finance, usually working 9 to 3 and my husband, Kevin, is a Locomotive Engineer who works a split shift from 5 am to 10 am and then again from 3 pm to 8 pm. We are both working Monday to Friday with weekends off.  We have three children, Ryan is a freshman in college, Matthew is a 7th grader at the Middle School who plays basketball and my husband is the coach and he plays for st patrick's school too , and Cait is a 4th grader at the elementary school.  We are busy with sports and choir here and there but live near the Guiding Eyes center in Yorktown .  My parents live down the block from us so they lend a hand too.  I think the kind of puppy that would work best for us if there is such a thing is a calm, low maintenance - meaning not hyper - puppy.  We have done puppy socializing quite a bit and can clearer see such a difference in the puppies and their personalities and needs within the litter.  It is really fascinating really.  We also live up the block from the center of town which is a great opportunity for walking and the track is right there too which is great.  We have access to the trains as we are both employed and could offer that stimulation as well.  Even in my office, I could bring the puppy if it was ok or helpful and approved of course to get that exposure to that kind of environment too.  I also do substitute teaching for CCD (religious catholic classes for grades 2 through 8 ) on Monday nights when my children attend.  They call me when they need help which is quite often.  Again, we would only bring the puppy where GEB says is approved to bring them.    AGAIN, even though we can incorporate the puppy into our daily lifestyle, while doing the socializing of the puppies, we all agreed that the low key, quiet, calm, puppies seemed to work the best in our home with all that goes on each day.    we had a yellow lab we adopted/purchased 12 years ago who was jus a love.  we have been enjoying doing the puppy socialization and felt ready for this next step.

However, when I do sit, I plan to work around my schedule so that the pup has all the attention it needs and I'm not multi-tasking with something else. I think my schedule is pretty flexible currently. I have one class on Tuesday's and Thursday's, then tutor for one hour at the Writing Center. So I think those days I'd have a lot of time for sitting. My Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's are a bit more hectic, so I'd have to plan more carefully when saying yes or no to a raiser for sitting. My weekends usually allow for some down time where I'd be able to sit. However, my weekend plans change constantly as the days go by. Therefore, I would also take careful consideration into making time for sitting a pup. I'm excited to begin volunteering and helping where I can."

I work there from 4:30 until 8:45 and head back to my dorm afterwards. I'll usually call my parents on Fridays to let them know how I'm doing. Then my roommate and our friends will lookfor something to do like go downtown or go to an IC After Dark Event.  Saturdays are my free day. I'll catch up on all the homework for Monday, sleep in until 9 or 10, and maybe go downtown or for a hike. Some Saturdays I will just stay in and do nothing. I really don't have any set schedule for these days because every Saturday I do something different.   Sundays I try and get to church, although that doesn't always happen. I can only get to the one o'clock mass because I have work at 4:30 in Terraces. Most of Sunday is either spent sleeping or doing up some last minute homework for the next day. After work I usually relax for a bit and do nothing until I go to sleep around midnight and start up Monda's schedule."

282, ,0,0,Fingerlakes,,,,11/07/14,"I am a full time veterinary student. Live in a house with practically no neighbors except for the winery next door that even on days when they have live music I cannot hear a thing (weird at the beginning but perfect for a student!). I have two housemates that are also veterinary students and we have a cat named Kate that loves dogs. My house has two floors and a basement. My housemates are willing to help in raising the puppy in the guiding eyes way.     I usually wake up at 6:15 am and do a couple of things (normal morning stuff like showering, having breakfast, preparing my lunchbox) before leaving the house at 7:32 am for class at 8:00 am. Some days (like for the next 2 months actually) I have class at 9 am instead, so I wake up at 7:00 am and leave the class around 8:10 am. My schedule is very variable and depends on the classes that I am taking and the work schedule at the hospital for the semester, but the sitter system at Cornell is outstanding in my opinion.     Once a year I travel back home to Puerto Rico to visit my family and have a necessary dose of my precious island so I would need a puppy who could travel, although I wouldn't mind having someone in the program watch him for the 2-3 weeks I'm home.     My weekends are quite light. I use them to study and I work a shift at my job at the pharmacy once a month. I usually spend them at home."

My classes are spread out so I have large gaps in between each one, sometimes it could be a couple hours. I am very flexible with my schedule in between classes as well as after classes and at night. When I have shorter breaks in between my classes, this causes me not to be as flexible. My weekend days are generally open and I am very flexible. I live in a puppy friendly building so it would not be a problem at all having one of the puppies in my room!"
284, ,0,0,Fingerlakes,,,,11/08/14,"We live on Cornell Campus where my husband is house dean of Alice Cook House, one of the Cornell West campus dorms. Our apt is spacious, and our backyard is Cornell grounds. Lots of space, people for socialization.    I'm a veterinarian at Cornell Vet College and teach classes every morning from 8:30am until 11:30am only during the fall semester. My afternoons are very flexible. My husband works next door to our apt, and his schedule is flexible. He teaches in the evening. My husband had experience raising collies when he lived in England. We are a dog family!    Our daughter who is also taking the training classes with me is in high school. Her schedule is not flexible, but after  after 4pm she is at home and wants to be an active raise/sitter.    We have another daughter in college who can't wait to come home and encounter a dog. She has been reading the instructions on how to raise a pup from the guiding eyes webpage.    Most weekends we are free, or travel for a volleyball game when my daughter is playing. We often go for walks around campus and around Ithaca parks, and downtown. We go to most of the music concerts on campus (CU and IC), and often have a musical recital in our apt.    A dog in our house would be an enormous improvement on campus life experience for Cornell undergrad students . We had a dog for 20 years and while living on campus this dog helped many students to overcome stress during finals, etc. Unfortunately our dog died a year ago, with almost a age record for a York Terrier.      We are all eager to learn how to raise/sitter a guiding dog.  Thanks for the opportunity."

On a typical day, I go to my classes from 8am to mid-afternoon, then sometimes work at A&S Career Services, then go back to my dorm.  I eat dinner, do homework, relax a little, and then go to bed.  On weekends, I spend most of my time studying in my dorm.  Obviously, my time in class is inflexible, and I am most flexible in the afternoons of both weekdays and weekends."
286, ,0,0,Fingerlakes,,,,11/08/14,"I plan to be a babysitter until junior year because I am studying abroad in the spring of my sophomore year. I am dedicated to running track at Ithaca College, my internship at Saltonstall Art Colony (once a week on Wednesdays), and Guiding Eyes for the Blind. Next semester when I babysit, all my classes will be done by 1pm. I do not work. I don't go out to party on the weekends. Most nights are spent watching Netflix with food and friends. I live in a single dorm room, and my RA is completely fine with me babysitting a puppy. I am very active and would be able to keep up with the energy of a puppy. My roommate next year, sophomore year, is part of Guiding Eyes and eventually wants to babysit as well, so we figured out that we can work well living together next year while I babysit puppies.     My typical day includes waking up at 7am. I go to class at 8am on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Then I don't have class until 3pm. After my 3pm class, which ends at 3:50, I go back to my dorm. I change and get ready for practice at 4pm. My practice ends at 5:30 on most days. If it is a Monday, I go back t my dorm, shower, and then head to Textor Circle to go to Puppy Class. On Tuesday and Thursdays, I have class at 9:25-10:40am. Then I don't have class until 4-5:15pm. I head to practice after class, and my workouts usually on take 30 minutes. So I have a lot of free time to babysit puppies and give them the attention they need. Next year, as I mentioned before, I am going to study abroad in Australia during the spring semester. During junior year, I plan to live off campus with four girls including me. We all love dogs and they have even encouraged me to raise one. I will have a car junior year too."

When I get home I give my dogs breakfast and then go get ready for the school. At about 7, I pack lunch and my backpack, and let my dogs outside in my fenced backyard. I have a pretty flexible schedule, obviously school isn't very flexible, but I don't do after school activities except wednesdays, I do agility with my dogs (Teddy and Colbie) for an hour each. My weekends are usually empty, or very flexible. I live in a raised ranch house at the end of a dead-end street in a quiet neighbor hood off of Snyder hill. There is a park near by that I pass through in morning walks and often take my dogs to play on weekends. My house is usually calm, excluding my 10 year old sister who enjoys doing gymnastics in our living room, but will stop if she's asked. I think the longest I would ever be away is my family's annual summer vacation to the Adirondacks, but that is never more than two weeks and we always bring our dogs. I am so thankful for this opportunity and am very excited to continue learning!"
288, ,0,0,Fingerlakes,,,,11/07/14,"The Chang family consists of four of us.  My husband, Chet, works full-time Monday thru Friday during the day. Alex(13) and Abby(11) both attend middle school and have a few various activities after school.  I am a homemaker and have some flexibility in my schedule. I do a fair amount of volunteering. Currently some of my time is spent at the school, the SPCA, the Food Pantry and I may be starting at the Pregnancy Resource Center.  None of these involve a strict schedule and most don't take up more than 2-3 hours at a time.  Our weekends are fairly flexible too.  Alex is intending to play basketball with the Y so we can pretty much count on one game every weekend.    One of our favorite forms of volunteering is foster kittens for the SPCA. We keep them until they are old enough/big enough to be adopted and then we return them to the SPCA for them to find their forever home.  Currently we have fostered 107 kittens/cats. The fosters stay in our finished basement and are kept separate from our family pets other than an occasional supervised visit after the kittens have been with us long enough to feel confident they are disease-free. We are willing to possibly take a break from the kittens if we find doing both a puppy and the kittens too demanding at the same time.      We live in a single family home in a residential area with a fairly large fenced backyard. We have two cats and two dogs, a 14-year-old Lab/Border Collie mix and a 6-year-old miniature poodle.  The dogs will probably be our biggest question with a puppy.  In the past, they have had issues with other dogs but recently we have had an adult Yorkie spend the day at our house several times and there were no issues what-so-ever.      I guess the other possible unique thing about us is that we live at the edge of the Finger Lakes Region and the Southern Tier Region. We have taken our pre-placement classes with the Finger Lakes Region but will probably attend more classes with the Southern Tier Region.  Both Cassie Houghton and Sandy Shaw have communicated with each other about this situation and seemed okay with it."

290, ,0,0,Central NY,,,,11/06/14,"On a typical day, I wake up at 7 in the morning, with a GEB puppy that would no longer be an option, and that's completely okay. I got to class for 3 hours from 8 to 11 and then I usually have a short break, before my next class at 1:55, them I'm in that class for three hours. But this schedule is only lasting until the end of this semester. Next semester I will have Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays free after 10AM. Tuesday and Thursday will be very busy days for me and will only have a brief time for a break to the pup will either have to travel with me if approved by the Professor or stay with a sitter because I will have no time to go back to my room. During the weekends, I tend to stay in and don't go out until my friends wish to do something. During summer break I work the night shift at the Post Office and get home at 7 in the morning and sleep usually half the day because of that schedule. I may need to change this schedule to accommodate the pup or make a schedule for myself. I have a small dog at home who is 4 years old and she doesn't have a problem with big dogs or puppies once she gets to know them. She is actually a big old wuss when it comes to meeting new dogs, but once she warms up she is fine. In short I have every opportunity to change my schedule to flex with the life of having a puppy and it'll still be workable."

And sometimes we have to do overnights and leave Friday for our game on Saturday. But once season is over our team meets a couple times a week to do strength and condition for about an hour or two. And that is what my schedule is like for the rest of this semester. And when I return to my home for breaks and summer I am trying to find a part time job so for now I have a lot of free time and will be home for longs times during the day. We have a 6 year old cockapoo (cocker spaniel poodle mix) at home who like to lounge around but does get excited when she can run around our yard. We live in a very rural area and our house is not close to other houses. We have a big front yard and are secluded by trees. Next semester though when i return to school, I plan on taking 2 classes a day and certain days i have more time in between than others. I have not registered yet so the schedule i have planned could be changed, but also i will continue with strength and conditioning twice a week for an hour or two than 4 weeks or spring field hockey with practices 4 times a week. And over the January term I should be taking a class that will take place for 4 days out of the week and should be a couple hours out of my day, if I can register into my class choices.

In addition to classes, I have an internship at a local horse barn (Canterbury Farms). Every Tuesday I take care of the nightly needs of nine horses. On Fridays I have a riding lesson and work on an assigned ""project"". Projects include de-cobbwebbing the barn, painting fences, and cleaning water buckets. I return to the farm on Sundays for projects and the afternoon shift. Generally, a normal shift will take three to four hours.     On school breaks, I go back home in North Smithfield, Rhode Island. Most of my time is spent at my mother's house, however my parents are divorced and I do spend a few days at a time at my father's house (also in North Smithfield). I have three younger siblings who additionally rotate their time between our parents. Sarah and Brian are seniors in high school and both work at a restaurant 15 minutes from home (either house). Jeffrey is in eighth grade and plays soccer on the weekends. He occasionally pet-sits for my grandmother's Bichon Frise. My mother works full time for a finance management company. My father, a teacher, lives with his girlfriend in a two-story house with a finished basement and a fairly large yard. My mom lives in a first-floor apartment which has three bedrooms (it is fairly spacious). There is additionally a large yard in front and in back of the apartment. We have two cats and a female chihuahua. Generally, the cats will get along well with my dog, Maggie, however, Maggie does occasionally chase my female cat, Spooky when she comes in from being outside. Our male cat, Fuzzles is strictly an indoor cat. All of our pets receive Frontline regularly."

I live in my sorority house at the University of Rhode Island Campus called Chi Omega.  While living in the house, I am permitted to puppy sit, but not raise, for the environment isn't the best to raise a puppy.      In my home in Bristol, RI, I live with my parents, brother, and grandparents during the summer.  This environment isn't okay to raise in either: my parents have 4 cats and 2 crazy pups that a puppy would pick up bad habits from.  Also, my grandmother had a kidney transplant that doesn't allow her to be in close proximity to animals (my parents live in the basement to separate from my grandmother on the first floor).    I have 2 jobs I do every weekend during the school year and then work full time in the summer.  My first is I am a Kennel Attendant at Harbor Animal Hospital.  My shifts there are usually from 7am to 3pm.  My second job is doing care for elderly people at an assisted living home called Atria Bay Spring Village in Barrington, RI.  My shifts there vary from 3pm to 11pm, to 11pm to 7am.  I am a per-diem employee there and I have been with the company for 3 years.

My schedule on the weekends is less structured and very flexible, while my schedule during the week is more rigid because I have a few hours of class every day.

317, ,0,0,Eastern CT,,,,10/15/14,"I am a first-year college student at the University of Rhode Island and I am majoring in Animal and Veterinary sciences with a pre-vet track. Sometime in the future I hope to go onto vet school. When not at school, I live an hour away from campus in Southeast Massachusetts. I am the youngest in my family and currently the only ""child"" living at home with my parents, so many active and small children in the house will definitely not be a concern. I live in a typical single family home with a large yard in a quiet neighborhood. I will add that my yard is not fenced in (we taught all our previous dogs at a young age to never leave the yard and had no problems, but I am more than willing and understanding to the importance of having the GEB puppy on a leash at all times when in my yard). I work about 5 minutes from my house at a small animal hospital. I have interned as a veterinary assistant there, and I am currently working there as a kennel technician. The great thing about this job is that as an employee I would be allowed to bring my guiding eyes puppy with me to work each day and he/she would be surrounded by many people who have high dog knowledge. At work I would also have access to a large fenced yard to allow the puppy to get plenty of exercise. When on break from school, I typically work either a 6 or 11 hour shift, 3-4 days per week. As I said the puppy could come with me to work, but if for some reason he/she needed to remain at my house, I would only be 5 minutes away and able to come home often to let the puppy out.         As far as my lifestyle goes, I like to be active and travel, but very rarely do I travel far! My family owns a house in New Hampshire by a lake so I like to spend time up there in the summer and occasionally on weekends in the winter. We have a boat there that we take out on our lake - my sister's female black lab really enjoys the boat and likes to come with us sometimes! I like to spend my free time either outside (unless it is freezing!) or with some type of animal. 2 years ago my sister got her first dog of her own, a female black lab puppy named Khloe. I was lucky enough to be selected as her main obedience ""trainer"" and I love working with her - she is an all around great dog!           Everybody in my family loves dogs and would be more than willing to help out in any way possible with the puppy. Two of my older siblings are married and have their own houses, but they are both within 20 minutes of my house, so there would be plenty of opportunity for me to take the puppy to their houses and get him/her used to different environments.         My goal in raising a puppy is to have it with me almost all day long - I really want to bond with it and be a good leader that builds the dog's confidence. I cannot wait to see a guiding eyes puppy grow and develop and be introduced to new situations, and most importantly, to one day be matched with someone who's life he/she will change forever!"

I also like to be busy, so I will go to town to run errands or just occupy myself often. I think that a dog really fits in anywhere easily other than when I go to the gym because I wouldn't be able to keep an eye out (obviously). I don't go home often, so that is not an issue. I would be willing to have a dog stay with me over any break, even if is just Fall Break to give the raiser a few days off. I have close by neighbors, but I have had my own dog stay in my apartment and they all loved her so there is no issue with them.

There is also a dog living in the house who belongs to one of the seniors, but he is very obedient and can be locked in a bedroom if/when another puppy is in the house - he is used to this when other cats/dogs come over for a few hours.  He is very friendly and does well with other dogs, but we tend to just avoid any issues by making him leave the main room.  Weekends for me are generally very flexible.

If it's a hot day, we'll have a 30 minute walk; if not, yoga class for me until 9AM, then maybe another walk for Gemma. (I'm a 62 year old retired attorney with a hip replacement--so please don't give me a bouncing-off-the-wall pup! I can't run too far!! Also just recovered from major surgery this past winter! Otherwise very strong and pretty fit for an old lady)    Then it's down to housework, email, errands, laundry until lunchtime.      After lunch, could be another walk, puppy play-time (for Gem), quiet reading or computer work.      I volunteer at a soup kitchen two days a week for a couple of hours in the afternoon to prepare dinner for area homeless folks.    I do a lot of cooking and entertaining here and prepare meals to take to my elderly mother-in-law as well.    Our daughter works full time (college grad), so no soccer games or travel teams for us!  My husband is an attorney (his own firm) and is fully employed and engaged at least 5 1/2 days a week. I am the home-body.    Week-ends are pretty open--socializing with friends, gardening, movies, concerts or boating in the summer.    We live in a suburban Stamford neighborhood, close to Long Island Sound, with beaches and lovely quiet walking opportunities nearby as well as access to bustling downtown Stamford (1 1/2 miles away)--great for socializing and new experiences for the puppy.    We don't have cats and not too many of our neighbors have outside cats; also no other pets or animals, with the exception of wonderful Gemma !

We live in Newtown, CT in a single family home.  It is ranch style.  Markus lives downstairs in a one bedroom apartment.  We live upstairs.  We have neighbors but not close enough to be a factor.  We have a small fenced yard for playing just off our kitchen.  Our property is 3.5 acres with bunnies, birds, turkeys, deer etc.  We have a large, sloping front yard and very long driveway.    My plan is to take my puppy to school with me.  I have permission from my superintendent and principal.  I have a large office, room for a crate, and easy access to outdoor space for voiding.  My students are accustomed to dogs at school as I bring therapy dogs quite freqently as my friend raises one given to her after the Sandy Hook tragedy.  My day is quiet in the mornings, busy during recess, and then quiet at the end.  I work 8:45-3:45 and some days my son will be able to be home to let puppy out to pee.  On those days, puppy will be home.  I have raised two collies, two labs, and one Rhodesian Ridgeback.  We lost our ridgeback last year at age 12 and feel we have lots of love to give to raise a puppy.  I will be the primary raiser since I am the one home.  My son is a recruited football player and has many responsibilities with that.  He will leave for college probably in Feb. if he is asked to graduate early.  My husband works in NYC and lives there during the week so the responsibility is primarily mine.    This is just something I have always wanted to do.  Hopefully I will make a great raiser!"

I am an Associate Professor at New York Medical College in Valhalla NY and even though it involves teaching it is full time year round.  I also do side work for a medical journal and work on reviewing medical cases for lawyers.  When I am not working I am doing projects around the house or in the yard.  Since my wife doesn‚Äôt work we do go on short trips on the weekends in the summer but stay in most other weekends.  Sometime we will walk around the block or I‚Äôll go for a bike ride but not often.  My daughter lives with us and works very close to home.  She would be the primary raiser or sitter for the Guiding Eyes dog and we are here to support here and to learn the process too.  She is very involved in the home socializing program and we love having the puppies at our house and seeing how smart they are at a young age.

I just like being at home and I don‚Äôt think I am an active person.  If we were to have a dog at the house I think it should be mellow for me to help because I don‚Äôt want to have really big dog pulling me around outside if I were to walk him.

I'll have Fridays off from school which is cool but I'll probably ave to work those days/weekends. To be honest I'm a little worried how it'll work out for me if we get the puppy but my parents work in rotations at their job so someone is always home, so the puppy will never be alone. And even if someone is out, we're never really gone for that long anyway (definitely not for 3-4 hours).     We also live in a quiet town, quiet street and we have the Rail trail close by which would be perfect for puppy walks and training and go into town.    In 2011 I did some online courses on vet assistance and learned a lot, and volunteered some of my time that summer to helping out at the vet. We also raised two puppies that year, Haley and Breeze, pretty much one after the other so it was like endless work. The vet studies helped me understand a lot of the dog behavior and I'm proud to say I think I helped train them a lot. Haley used to get me up around 5:30 every morning, as soon as the sun came up... as a light sleeper it was usually me who took her outside to go potties in the morning. It was very exhausting but it was fun. Both puppies are trained on the invisible fence now but I know this puppy can't do that. So I'll have to be ready for those mornings again!

I am hoping to bring the pup along with me during days at school/work, and because this is the first time my school will have a dog around their campus daily, I am kind of trying to tread carefully and have the least amount of problems possible, and so I was hoping, if possible, to get a very calm dog, one that would hopefully be able to settle during these times.        (If the school does not end up allowing me to take the pup along with me to classes or work, I have scheduled gaps in between my classes to make sure he won't be stuck in the crate for too long at a time.)       On Saturdays I am hoping to set up an internship at the local vet hospital, as I hope to go to vet school one day and need to start accumulating hours.       As of now, I plan to attend the NYC puppy classes on Sunday nights, but I might see what other options there are and see which region best fits my schedule, if that's alright with you guys!           I do live in a house, but there is an apartment building next door, which is about 3-4 feet away from my bedroom window. Actually, one of the apartments' windows is directly across from my bedroom window, which is another reason I was hoping for a pup on the calmer side.        This house, though, is my residence while at school. During holidays and after I graduate next year, I will most likely be staying at my parents' house in Yorktown Heights. The house is dog friendly, as is the neighborhood, the only things I can think of is first, that my parents also have a dog, and I am not entirely sure how best to introduce them, and second, I am not sure if this change of household would be stressful for the puppy."

His hearing and sight is going and has trouble with his hind quarter.  My son's fiancee has a dog and when they visit they normally bring the dog for the visit too.   John (husband) would be the primary trainer of the puppy since he generally works from home.  This would allow him time with the puppy for daily instruction, eliminating, exercising and monitoring,  I work (9-5) about 20 minutes from home.  On the occasions when John is not available I would be able to return home to let the puppy out for exercise and to eliminate ""get busy"".  Our neighborhood is an established sub-division with  a large number of houses. An early morning walk routine through the neighborhood would fit in nicely.  I did this for many years with the older dog and we both really enjoyed it! It kept us both in shape.  We have a large yard with a fenced in area where the puppy would be able to get some exercise while being off a leash.  John and I both pretty active and enjoy outdoor activities so I feel we will be able to exercise and socialized the puppy.   Our weekends can be busy but are pretty flexible.

Our high school daughter get home around 2:30.  With our current young dog (almost 2), we had a neighbor whom we paid to stop over during the day so exercise and toileting -- we would plan to do that again with this puppy.  Obviously school breaks, college breaks, and summer we are around.     Both of us have verbal permission from our school principals to bring dogs in to school once the time is appropriate.  In my classroom I have a large quiet backroom that would be a good way to introduce both the dog and the students to the school setting.      We also have 2 family dogs - Tessa a 9 year old golden retriever who is sweet but not overly bright, and Hobbes, perhaps a short-haired collie who is very bright and inquisitive.  Mickey, the cat is also a family member, and we currently have a stray foster kitten (probably a month) who has been bottle fed. Our dogs have been trained on Invisible Fence, but  we would not use that with a Guiding Eyes puppy.

388, ,0,0,Monroe,,,,06/04/14,"I'm retired, live alone,  and currently do not own any animals.  I owned two wonderful Golden Retrievers - Ginger Female first  (1998-20010, then Jake (1999-2013) , the male,  from the same sire.  I took them both for puppy and adult training, and found a way to work their care and exercise into a demanding work schedule.  Weekends were devoted to them.   When I Moved to Pittsford in 2004, the dogs chose the house.. a Cape Cod with downstairs bedroom (in prep for aging joints),a fenced yard, and vicinity to public parks and paths for long walks and proximity to excellent vet care Mendon Village Animal Hospital).  I'm in a neighborhood with houses close by, and other owners with dogs who also have fenced yards.    My life always revolved around my dogs and their needs.  My typical day is up at 8AM, turn on the radio,  get the paper (that used to be Jake's job), have breakfast.  My days vary, and are very flexible,  with errands, home projects, gardening, appointments, library etc.  I belong to GEVA, and Arts and Lecture - evening events that don't exceed 3-4 hours,  I also attand a bi monthly card group that again does not exceed 3-4 hours.  My dogs were what I thought of as well behaved (compared to other friends dogs) , were NEVER overly aggressive to people or other animals (unless attacked and had to defend themselves).  I'm not comfortable with German Shepards (got bit as a child) or overly exuberant, agressive,  LARGE (90+ lbs) animals.  I miss the discipline of owning an animal.  I'm comfortable brushing, training, clipping nails, bathing, fixing injuries, dispensing medication, giving subcutaneous shots, cleaning pee and poop and any other physical care required of an animal.  I'm ready for another animal, but not a ""life long"" animal due to the cost involved (usually at the end stages of life).  SinceJake died 6 months ago, I've been dog sitting for friends, and found this helps meet   my need for a pet.  However, I feel I'd like to contribute to society and find the concept of raising an animal which can change the life of an individual something I'd like to pursue."

He will also be around other animals, traffic, and people who will respect his particular needs.   I expect he and will be as one and know what each expects of one another. The pup will get me up in the morning and we will meet his immediate need, the exercise and then eat. We will do training and his body language will probably tell me he needs to nap. If I am in the yard he will be with me to smell and get to know the yard. He will meet my neighbors so they know what he is all about and what the program is about. There is a fenced yard across the street where he can be let loose for a short period. And againg play for him and me will be very fun. If I do travel, which I like to do, he will always be with me.

395, ,0,0,Monroe,,,,05/30/14,"I think I born a dog lover!  For most of my life I have lived in a house with a dog.  My first volunteer job was working at Lollypop farm.  As soon as I was old enough this turned into a paid position.  In addition, I helped with their pet therapy program.  I also assisted as a wildlife rehabilitator and fostered kittens, which needed to be hand fed.  As a young teenager, I taught dog-obedience classes through my 4-H club.  I have wanted to raise a seeing eye puppy for a very long time, but the timing in my life hasn't been right until now.            I live with my husband, Mark and our two boys, Spencer and Andrew.  Spencer is 13 in seventh grade and Andrew 10 in fourth grade. Our dog Molly is a 16 year old Beagle mix.   We have a two story, house in a suburban development in Fairport, NY.  My husband is a civil engineer for the NYS department of transportation.  During the week he gets up early and then leaves the house by 6:30 am.  He gets home from work between 3:15 and 3:30.  He is home on weekends.  In addition, he volunteers at our local fire department.  Mark is in full support of me becoming a guiding eyes puppy sitter/raiser and is willing to help me whenever he is able.        My son Andrew attends school in Fairport, at the same elementary school where I teach.  He is an animal lover and will enjoy helping with the puppy.  He rides to and from school with me every weekday.        My son Spencer arrives home from school at about 2:45.  He is very responsible.  I trust him 100% to take care of a puppy's needs when I am not there.       I am a special education teacher at Brooks Hill School in Fairport.  I leave my house at about 8:15 every morning and return home at about 3:50 pm.  I live fairly close to my place of work, a 6-7 minute commute time. Most years, I have time to go home for lunch and would be able to attend to a puppy for a short time mid-day.  I don't know my schedule for the following school year until August.  I can't be certain how long my lunch break will be until then.  (Some years my planning period and lunch are back- to -back, which would give me more time at home mid-day.)  I am home on weekends and school vacations.  I do not work during the school's summer vacation either.       My parents live less than 5 minutes from my house.  They too are dog -lovers.  They are retired and would be able to help out with the puppy by letting it out mid-day.  However, they do travel to Florida for a couple of months in the winter.  They currently own an 11 year old English Style Yellow Labrador Retriever.  We have talked and they are in full-support with assisting me with this important work.  They are also willing to follow the guiding eyes for the blind policies and methods.             My husband and I , as well my parents, own neighboring cottages on Rushford Lake in Allegheny County, NY.  If approved by guiding eyes for the blind, this would provide the puppy with many rich experiences.         I am very passionate about learning to be the best puppy sitter/ raiser I can be.  I am determined to learn from your methods and raise a puppy who is successful in becoming an official guide dog."

I get to work by about 8:00 AM (and my workplace is puppy-friendly, so the pup will be able to come with me).  I usually am able to come home at lunchtime if needed, and if I am unable to be home at lunch, my husband will be home at lunch.  I am a self-employed attorney and my husband is in graduate school so we are able to make our own schedules.  The only time that my schedule is not flexible is if I am required to be in Court.  During those times, I have two wonderful co-workers who are willing to ensure that the pup is properly supervised and allowed outside.  I can also work from home a couple of times a week, which will make supervising the pup even easier.     After work, I spend time before dinner with our dogs in the backyard.  We have two wonderful adult dogs, Wicket (Brussels Griffon, age 9) and Riley (husky-hound mix, age 2).  If it is not hot, we go for an additional walk, but it gets very hot in North Carolina in the summer, so we will usually put off the walk until after the sun goes down.  I learned in the training materials that we are already doing something that GEB requires, which is incorporating training into our daily experiences.  Riley has a relatively short attention span so we learned early on that long training sessions will not work with him.        During the day I have many interactions with multiple new people.  I also spend a lot of time in the courthouse.  I am sure that our Clerk and Judges will not mind my bringing a service dog to Court once he is old enough and confident enough to handle the experience.  Our pups will also have many confidence- building experiences in the office.      We have many wonderful local and state parks to ensure that the pups get great outdoor stimulation on the weekends.  Typically, we go for one short walk on one weekend day and one longer hike on the second weekend day.  Our favorite local spots to walk are Tanglewood Park, Reynolda Gardens, and Salem Lake.  The state parks of Stone Mountain, the Blue Ridge Parkway, Hanging Rock and Pilot Mountain are all close by.     I have trained three very-well behaved dogs so far.  Riley, our newest dog, has been a challenge because unlike our other two dogs (Sam, who is deceased, and Wicket), Riley is very shy.  The first day we had him, I took him for a walk and he was so scared that he wrangled out of his collar (which we promptly tightened) and ran all the way back home.  Luckily, we live on a quiet, dead-end street.  We have worked with him a lot to increase his confidence and we practice calm leadership with him at all times.  The progress he made not only makes me happy, but I know that it also makes him much happier to be out in the world with less fear.    We have a large yard, almost one acre, although only a portion of it is fenced right now.  We will ensure that until the full backyard is fenced, the pup is not allowed off of a leash in the unfenced yard.      I have always had male dogs and if, possible, I would love to be able to have males in the program.  Dogs and training dogs well are my passion and I am so excited about learning the GEB methods and helping to raise a confident and calm guide dog!"
403, ,0,0,North Carolina,,,,05/23/14,"A typical day involves waking up, eating breakfast, getting ready for work, going to work (and working!), going home, and relaxing. Three days out of the week I take an evening martial arts class (these are an hour long). Fortunately, I have a very understanding boss and my schedule can be pretty flexible. Normally I work all day, but we've already discussed what my life will be like with a GEB puppy to raise and I've been given permission to go home every couple of hours to let the pup out for get busy breaks and some training and play time before I have to go back to work. The landlord at the office has also given me permission to bring my pup to work when he's ready, provided he wears his little vest when walking around outside my office. I'm not really interested in socializing outside of work and the martial arts class I take (in other words, I don't have a wild social life that includes parties and dinner with friends every night of the week - I'm partial to quiet time: going for walks, sitting on the deck, reading, watching TV, etc). That's not to say I won't take my pup out to socialize him, because I most definitely will! I keep my weekends pretty open. If the weather's nice, I like doing yard work. If it's raining or too cold for comfort, I tend to stay inside and sew or paint or write or catch up on TV that I've missed. In either of those situations, I can already think of so many little instances I could slip training moments into! I'm accustomed to large dogs - I grew up with greyhounds (who were very well behaved) and volunteered at the local shelter (where the dogs usually weren't well behaved!). I also love dog training (even though I have no formal training on how to train dogs - I really made it up as I went at the shelter, tailoring my methods to each dog's needs, but I preferred positive reinforcement and for the most part they seemed to respond better to it than correction-based training). I live in a ranch house that backs up to the woods. I have neighbors who have outdoor cats who sometimes wander through our yard (to chase squirrels or birds, usually). We get deer wandering through (usually to eat our veggies). Our yard currently isn't fenced (it has a fence on three sides but not the fourth), but we've been thinking about having it done. I don't have any physical limitations (currently, that I'm aware of...haha!) and I'm not expecting any big changes in my life soon. I'd love to go to grad school for creative writing, but that's probably a couple years off... I'm really excited to start the pre-placement journey and (hopefully!) volunteer my time and home and raise a puppy!"
404, ,0,0,North Carolina,,,,05/20/14,"I am a married stay at home mom for three children.  They include a thirteen year old boy and eleven year old twin girls. We have three dogs of our own that I feel will be fine with a puppy. One six year old Great Dane, one four year old Lab (best guess since it was a puppy from a stray) and one 8-10 year old Basset/Beagle mix (from Tri County Animal Rescue). We have had cats also, but they we believe they we taken by an owl in back so we probably won't be getting any more cats at this time.    My day starts at 6:00am during the week with getting the kids breakfast and having them get ready for school. Once they are at school my day is usually at home doing laundry, baking, cleaning or doing something on the computer. I do go grocery shopping and run errands, but I am able to be back within two to three hours. Our weekends are usually spent doing something outside such as hiking, swimming in our creek or going to a park. We much rather be active than sitting around so a puppy should get enough exercise with us.     My day usually ends about 10:00pm.  The Dane sleeps on couch cushions next to our bed, the Lab in kenneled and the Beagle/Basset will usually sleep on the couch downstairs. This will be the most difficult part for the puppy, I believe, since all of our animals are allowed the bad habit of going on the couch and jumping on the bed. I think if we train the puppy correctly from the start this won't be an issue.     We are very excited for this opportunity to raise a puppy that could help someone so much! This is a new adventure for us and we all want to do it as well as we can."

From September - June I will be in school from 6:30am - 3:15pm (I may be able to bring the dog into school with me me during some classes and also into doggy day care.

I also go to bed at 9:20 and that can also be later for the puppy.  Weekend scheduled I am usually home and will be able to take the dog places.  My evenings and weekends are very flexible so I can do many things with the puppy.  I live on a 1 arc house in a quiet cul de sac with some walkers.  I have a 4 year old black Lab girl, and 2 Honey Bee hives.  We have woods on to sides of our property.  We also have a house with some dogs a few houses down from us.

On weekends and during the summer, I will have a lot more free time when I could spend more time with the dog.  I also take care of two guinea pigs along with the rest of my family so we would have to teach the dog to interact with them in a calm manner.

I work at Palmer's Veterinary Clinic as a Veterinary Assistant during the summer and on academic breaks from school. I usually only work around 4 hours at a time. If I am working a longer shift one of my parents are willing to let the puppy out of his crate appropriately. I also camp during the summer where there are lots of socialization chances for the puppy. I generally work at least one day of the weekend as well. On days that I am off I like to go hiking, and watch different sporting events outside. My summer schedule is very flexible as long as I know ahead of time when events/classes are so I can let my supervisor know.

412, ,0,0,Ohio,,,,05/03/14,"I am home a good part of each day if not the whole day.  I rise at 6:OO AM most days leave at 6:30 AM for about two and a half hours to attend Mass and pray a bit but am home by 9:00 AM.  Several times a week I visit my older sister in a nursing home and usually take my dog with me. She is a two and a half year old silver Labrador named Lady that I adopted a year ago. Most of the residents call her by name and enjoy petting her and giving her treats (part of her day's kibble). I'm there 2-3 hours at a time.      Thursday evenings I volunteer with the GEB training classes throughout the evening. This would obviously change if I became a puppy raiser.     On occasion, maybe 2-3 times a month, I accept a dinner invitation to a girlfriend's house, Both do not live far and I arrive around 6:00 PM and am usually home by 9:00 PM.  I'm on a retreat team that meets every other week for 2 hours at a local parish about 13-15 minutes away by car. The retreat is in the Fall of 2014 and so this would be over by October. I attend various programs offered by our local parishes, usually in the evening for a couple of hours with less than 5-8 minutes driving time each way.     I had some major surgery within the past two months and am improving well. However, certain movements are limited and I should not lift anything over 4 lbs for several more months. For this reason,  I know it will be some time before I can become a puppy raiser but I can volunteer for upcoming Meet & Greets, fundraisers and other programs as well as help with training.    I have owned and trained dogs for myself and my friends since high school and even taught private dog obedience on the side when I first started my career as a teacher. Though I'm still on their books as a part-time employee as a certified dog trainer at our local PetSmart (went through their training program) of only one or two evenings a week for about 3-4 hours, they have had to cut back last Fall so I've only worked a total  of four hours since then.  Now with surgery, I am unable to work as I have these physical limitations.     I own a two family home in a residential neighborhood. Many people walk their dogs down my street although they don't necessarily live on the street. Most of my neighbors are dog friendly people and don't mind the dogs if their owners clean up after them. I have a fenced in yard where I exercise Lady each day but am unable to walk her (she is lean and all muscle and weighs in at 69 lbs.) because I cannot run the risk of anything causing her to pull on her leash and my having to offer sufficient resistance. I have a couple of neighbors know my dog and will let Lady out to go to the bathroom and feed her dinner when necessary if I know I'm going to be gone for more than 5-6 hours.     I am both familiar with and comfortable with Labs, Goldens and Shepherds. I would prefer that my first dog not be a Shepherd as I think I need to give my myself sufficient time to heal."

In a typical week, I work 40-60 hours (in home, on an office and at clients homes), I shoot pool (billiards) 1-3 nights a week, spend time with friends and family members and at a therapeutic riding barn volunteering.     Work Schedule: I am responsible for managing my own schedule with clients. Since I have this opportunity, I am able to flex my schedule so that I can have home office days, take the pup/dog with me as I travel (leaving unattended for approx. 1 hour at a time) and planning times to exercise and work with the dog.     Weekend Schedule: Very flexible often including time at the therapeutic riding center, sometimes including pool, most times including time with family.     Flexible vs. Stiff: My lifestyle is generally pretty flexible. If I am expected to attend classes and/or meetings, I like to schedule those at least a week to two weeks in advance so that I can arrange other meetings/activities around them. The only rigid requirements I have for work is that it is mandatory for me to attend Staff Meeting on the third Friday of each month.     Living Arrangements: I live in a first floor apartment of a building with 11 other apartments in it. Most of the tenants I have spoken with about this opportunity seem genuinely interested and supportive. I have just moved to the building (End of March) and have spoken with the landlord about co-raising with Elora. At this time, he is supportive. I have a small dog (12 lbs) who lives with me. He has generally gotten along with GEB pups my sister has raised in the past.    Long-Term Absences:I will be in Orono from June 18-21 (away from home). I will be going to Texas at the end of July for about a week. I will be in Connecticut for a long weekend in August. I may be in Las Vegas for a week during May 2015 (most likely not) and will be in Alaska for 10 days in August 2015.     Family & Friends: I live independently with Tucker (small dog). My family and I are very close (relationship wise) and approx 20 min. apart travel wise. I will be working closely with Elora on raising as she has much more experience and is VERY good with her dogs. The pup will have exposure to a variety of human/animal interactions throughout its time with us as we have immediate family members ranging from 8 years old to 50 years old. I also have extended family and friends that are a variety of ages, with a variety of abilities/disabilities that will be exposed to the pup during our time together in a safe manner.     I hope this is helpful - I am an open book and more than happy to share further information that may be relevant to puppy raising. Thank you for all you do!!"

Having seen how important it is for raisers to have someone familiar with GEB policies take care of their puppies while on vacation or just away for a few days, I would enjoy the opportunity to help in this way.  Having raised 5 Labs over the years, I know and love them and miss having one in my life.  This seems like a wonderful way to have my 'dog fix' periodically and to assist others who are taking on the bulk of the puppy raising work."

Gretchen leaves for work at 8:30 or shortly after. We would both have a small amt of time to work w pup in the am. David works approx 30-45 min from home. Gretchen works less than a mile from home. Her work schedule is generally 9-5, but she can leave during the day to run home for a quick 25ish min break w the pup. David usually gets home between 4:30 and 5, sometimes as late as 6, but that is rare. We would be able to fit in socialization, exercise and play during the evening. Gretchen attends yoga class in the evening once/week, but otherwise we have no specific planned activities (other than dinner :). Gretchen usually cooks the meals so David would get slightly more pup time in the evenings. We live in the Eastport section of Annapolis (about a mile walk downtown). Though fenced, our yard is vy small, the back is essentially all gravel as a 'parking' space (though in the summer it is filled w potted tomato plants and never gets parked on). Our front yard is also small and really mostly all planted so we don't really have a traditional yard for a pup to play in. Weekends are spent w trips to the gym, yoga, errands and lots of yard work (David is obsessed w pulling weeds - hehe). Given our general nature and our small yard we would likely do best w an average to lower energy pup. We do know of tennis courts, ball fields, etc to take a pup too, but those require short drives. Any good hiking, which used to be a fav past time of Gretchen's takes a solid 45+ minutes drive so would likely only take place once or twice a month at best. Our neighbors are close by and we have a lot of diversity in the neighborhood (from all standpoints, race, age, singles, families, etc). Annapolis is a dog friendly town so there are always people about walking their pups."
424, ,0,0,Eastern MA,,,,04/12/14,"Konstantin and I live on the first floor of a condo complex. We have access to our patio and grass area via our sliding glass door. We live in a somewhat busy area, Fresh Pond by Alewife T station in Cambridge, MA, and have many businesses, sidewalks, and traffic lights near by. It tends to be a busy area during the day time/7 days out of the week but very quiet during the evening/night time.     We are both active people and love to be outdoors during the weekend, either going for runs, playing soccer, or doing some other outdoor activity. We both work full time. I work in a large corporate office in Wellesley and Konstantin works for a small startup in the Seaport area of Boston. I am able to work from home if necessary and can most likely bring the pup into the office. When I go into the office, I like to wake up around 6:30/7am and be at the office by 8am so that I can leave to come home around 4:30pm, however the times I go in and leave to come home are pretty flexible to an extent. Konstantin works in a laid back environment where he would be able to bring the dog to work if necessary. We also love relaxing at home and tend to have pretty flexible schedules during the weekends and weekday evenings.    Side note: we will be traveling for a week in the beginning of June (May 30th to June 8th) and will need a sitter for that one week.     We both have been looking forward to raising for some time now and are fully aware of the many responsibilities that it entails. We are ready to work hard and have fun doing it!

425,Primary,0,26852,Eastern MA,2W14,Walton,19154,04/11/14,"TLDR: Active lifestyle, very flexible schedule, 2 cats no kids.    I live in a 2-bedroom house on Cape Cod with my husband Tony and our two cats, Judge and Heathbar. I work as postdoc in geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, while Tony stays home, takes care of the housework, and volunteers with local animal rescue organizations. Although I work full time, I set my own hours and my schedule is very flexible. Some weeks, I work mostly on data analysis and writing. Those weeks, I typically go in to work Monday through Friday, 9-5, though aside from occasional seminars and lab meetings, it is possible for me to work from home many of those days if necessary (e.g., when we puppy-sit, I work from home while Tony does his volunteer shifts). Other weeks, when I am working in the lab, I typically work long days, 6 or 7 days a week, and may head into work as early as 6am and stay in lab as late as midnight. However, even those weeks, my schedule is fairly flexible, and it's not unusual for me to take a 1-2 hour break to play sports in the afternoon, run errands, or come home to eat dinner.    On a typical weekday, I will wake up around 6:30, make myself breakfast and read my email until about 7:30 or 8am. If I don't have any other sports/exercise plans later in the day, I will go for a jog if the weather is nice or ride my bike on an indoor trainer for half an hour or so if it's nasty out. If the weather is nice I will bike the 4 miles to work, otherwise I will drive or have Tony drop me off around 8:30-9:30am. At work, if I'm not busy with a project in lab, I spend most of my time in office, working on my computer, but I also attend one or two meetings per week. My workplace is very dog-friendly - it's very common to see a dog napping under someone's desk or wandering in the hall to visit people, there's an enclosed courtyard garden just steps from my office, and the campus is large and crossed with walking trails through rolling hills. However, I would probably not routinely bring a GEB pup to work with me because Tony could provide more stimulation at home and around town, and it also would not be safe to take the dog into the laboratory (chemicals, broken glass, very expensive instruments). In the afternoon, I will usual take about an hour break for exercise: sometimes Tony comes and plays tennis with me at work, or sometimes I will go for a jog or bike ride nearby, or swim at a local pool. Around 5 or 6, I come home and have dinner with Tony. Activities in the evening include biking on the trainer, jogging, or swimming if I haven't gotten any exercise yet that day, watching an episode or two of a sitcom with Tony, goofing on the internet, and some light chores. We're usually in bed by 10 or 10:30pm. Very few things in our shared weekly routine are formally scheduled aside from volleyball at the rec center form 6:30-9pm on Tuesdays and touch football in the park on Thursdays from 5-7 or Sundays from 11-1.    Weekends are even more flexible, and we usually fill them with projects around the house, long bike rides, day hikes in the woods, reading in a comfy chair while cuddling the cats, and generally living the good life. Now that the weather is finally getting warm, we're looking forward to spending a lot more time outside, working on our container garden on our deck, clamming, and swimming at the beach (which is a 3 minute walk from our house).    Our cats have been pretty good with the (older) pups we've puppy-sat for so far. We keep the cat food and cat litter in the second bedroom, so we do not allow dogs in there. When there's a dog in the house,  Heathbar, our 7-lb 19-year-old cat, mostly stays in that safe room, and waits until the dog is out on a walk or in her crate for the night to come request his pets and cuddles. He will hiss at a dog if he ends up cornered, but he doesn't try to attack and he's declawed anyway. Judge, our 14-lb 3-year-old cat, is very interested in the dogs and like to sneak around the perimeter of whatever area the dog is in. If the dog acknowledges his presence, Judge will hiss and growl; if the dog approaches, Judge will repeated whack it on the nose, but he does not extend his claws at all.    Our living space is pretty good for dogs. Our house is generally tidy, nothing lying around that a dog could eat (yes, I know if taken literally that statement is underestimating a puppy!), and our landlord has specifically approved raising a GEB puppy in our lease. The house we rent is in a quiet neighborhood about 1.5 miles from the heart of downtown Falmouth. We're on the ground floor of a 2-story house, but the upper floor is empty except for 1-2 weeks in the summer when our landlord uses it. Our yard is unfenced, but large with plenty of room to run on a long line. We're a short walk from the beach, but dogs aren't allowed on the beaches from May-Oct, so if we get a pup at the end of this PPC, she will have to wait a few months for that treat. Falmouth is a great town, with a cute downtown area along Main Street that includes sidewalks lined with many shops, restaurants, park, library, post office, etc. - lots of opportunities for new experiences!    We only have one car between the two of us: a VW Beetle, so pup would have to learn to ride in the wheel well. We are, however, considering becoming true Massachusettsians and buying a Subaru wagon.    In terms of how our lifestyle is likely to vary over the long run, my postdoctoral fellowship is currently funded only through June 1, 2015. There is a pretty good chance it could be extended until at least the end of August 2015, but that is not certain, and funding beyond that would depend on the success of future grant proposals, among other things, so there is a chance we may end up moving before our pup makes it to IFT. On the other hand, because of the smallness of Falmouth and the somewhat temporary and uncertain nature of the duration of our stay here, Tony really can't get a job related to his field of expertise (intellectual property law), so he will continue to be the volunteer/home-maker and have tons of time to devote to raising a puppy. In terms of travel, we always spend up to a week on the beach in Maine for an annual family reunion in August, which we would hope to take the pup along to if that's okay with GEB. We also like to head up to a family cottage on Lake Winnipesaukee as many long weekends as possible. I travel a for about a week at a time for conferences 1-3 times a year, but Tony usually stays home for those. We will be taking a 1-2 week vacation to South Africa this September, so we would definitely need a puppy-sitter for that. No other trips that big are anticipated in the next couple years. We will also probably travel to Florida and/or Philadelphia for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas to visit our parents, but in general we usually never travel for more than 3-10 days at a time and only a couple times a year.    We're looking forward to expanding the role of volunteering with Guiding Eyes in our lives!"

If weather is fine, kids, dog and I are outside for a while. From 4:00-5:00 is screen time while I make dinner.  Then we eat dinner and then homework and maybe back outside.  Bedtime about 9:00.  If we have puppy I may need to work less during the day and more when kids/husband are home to care for puppy.  Schedule is very open on weekends.      Our two kids don't really like organized activities, so our schedule is pretty loose.   We like to spend a lot of time outside.     Our house is on a 1/2 acre lot on very walk-able roads.

But I can't really think of anything else to say.    Amy"
429, ,0,0,Eastern MA,,,,04/02/14,"My husband Charlie and I are retired and are both interested in being puppy raisers and attending classes. We are lucky to be in good health so we have no limitations there. We love labradors and have had three at our present house over the last 40 years. Our two children are grown but live nearby. Our 3 young grandchildren are here visiting once in a while. Our house is on a busy street but we have a one acre lot and another grassy one acre field which has always been the favorite place of our dogs. Since we have not had a dog since last August we tend to sleep a little later but we are usually up by about 7:30.  We have a pretty leisurely morning most days and go for a walk for about a mile every afternoon weather permitting. Both Charlie and I are home most of the hours of the day but we are often out at the Town Hall for volunteer work, food shopping, card playing at the Senior Center or other short errands.  In June I go to Block Island, RI for the summer months. I do return once in a while but mostly I am away on Block Island. Charlie returns every week or so for several days. Weekly meetings would be difficult for us during this time.  If we needed to attend bi-weekly meetings  Charlie could be available to attend and I could come occasionally.  Weekly meetings would not be a problem in the winter.     We enjoy travelling and could possibly have a trip in the fall or spring.  We usually do not travel for more than a week or 10 days.     The labs that we have owned were 2 black males and 1 yellow female. Our preference would be a yellow female as this was our most recent dog. We think the best match for us would be a low key, low energy dog."
433, ,0,0,Westchester,,,,03/23/14,"Jonathan and I would very much like to be a part of the program.    Summer 2014:   For the summer months, I work 2-3 times a week in a local day camp im Mamaroneck.   I normally leave my house around 9am and my day ends around 3pm on the days I work.  I have flexibility in that I can go home for my lunch break if need be and I can adjust my schedule, but I will not know until the month of June.  On the days that I do not work, I am local to my home either running errands, visiting friends, hopefully biking, hiking, kayaking as well as working at home for school preparation and/or housework and alot of gardening.     This summer Jonathan is working at a golf club.  I usually take him anywhere from 7am to 8am then return home before I leave again around 9am.  Therefore we both have the opportunity to be out and about with a puppy before either of us goes out.  Jonathan typically returns home around 3PM as well.  He has a flex schedule too.  Jonathan might also be going on a few day trips for golf tournaments.  On those days, I either spend the day in the township of where he is playing or I return home and go back again.  We can take the puppy with us for the trip and excursion or return home.  Again this coming summer starting at the end of June we have all this flexibility. Additionally my two older daughters will be around coming and going either staying in the city, working, coming home for half days.  We usually have a visitor or two in the summer come visit and stay with us be it my girls friends or family from London.     Our challenges after the summer in all honesty is this scenario:    I work in a Day school in the Bronx approx 11 miles from our home.  Jonathan and I leave around 7:30am.  Taking care of a puppy in the morning before we leave is manageable.  Jonathan has done it many times tending to our neighbors dos over the years.  My husband leaves a bit later than us around 8:15 - 8:30.  I return home around 3:15-3:30.  We need to secure someone to come in during that time period to tend to the puppy.  There are various days throughout the school year that we have off due to the Jewish Holidays and National Holiday schedule as well where we will have no issues as well.      Fall 2014:   Monday  -  Thurs. schedule.  On Fridays I return home by 2PM the latest.  On weekends we are around all day Saturdays and Sundays we are up and about in and out going to sporting events, family get togethers, various functions."

I participate in co curricular activities at school that keep me late once a week, then I come home around 7:15 (pm). On saturdays I attend religious services from 8:45 (am) until 11:30 (am) and then come home for lunch and stay home the rest of the day. On sundays I am home the entire day working on schoolwork.   During the spring I work on sunday mornings from 7:30 until 1:30.

All of these will give the pup socialization experiences.  I walk a lot during the week as well.      We would like to try a shorter commitment first, such as puppy sitting or taking on an ""already started"" pup.  We will be unavailable July 2014.

I usually get home from school around 3:15 and then do my homework. I have a basketball game every Monday until the end of March,  but these games are only an hour long and should not require the puppy to have to stay alone, as my parents will be home during these games. Tuesday nights I have jazz band from 6-7, but again my parents will be home the whole time.   My schedule is very flexible as I will be the primary raiser in my house. Everybody in my house is definitely supportive and willing to help, but if will be the main raiser as far as taking care of and training the dog the way he is required to be trained. It is agreed, however, that we would like a male dog. We have no color preference, but my sister used to have a great fear of dogs and we build like a dog that is not as jumpy. Of course all dogs are playful and we do want a playful dog that likes to play with us, but we do not want a dog that is jumpy and barks a lot. Again, I am the primary raiser and my schedule is very flexible and everybody in the family is willing to help. I hope that you have a dog that fits our requirements but I understand that this is difficult and you may not have that dog for us. I cannot wait to raise a guiding eyes dog and I hope this helped you in the process of pairing me with a dog!"

Sam will be getting up with the puppy in the mornings and I will handle the puppy's care during the days when he is at school.  I do work.  I am a realtor and I also work two days a week at a needlepoint store here in Wilton.  My realtor job requires me to be on floor duty four times a month(one day is usually on the weekend.)for four hours at a time.  I do have flexibility with this so that I could run home and let the puppy out.  This job also entails me showing houses and or being at open houses, but I can manage that time pretty well and don't anticipate being away for more than four hours at a time.  As for the needlepoint store, I work Wednesdays and Fridays from 10-3.  I would also have flexibility in that I can run home and let the puppy out.    All of our family members are completely committed to this process, but one of my daughters is uncomfortable around jumpy dogs.  I say this because a dog with a calmer demeanor would work best in our home.  She will be home from college and spending the summer at home.  Her sister, our oldest child will be home for about five weeks and then be away for the summer.    On the weekends we are all in the house and would be able to spend alot of time with the puppy.  My biggest hurdle is that I will need ankle surgery to fix a broken ankle sometime in the near future.  I do feel like I can manage the puppy during this time and no date has been set as of yet."

My wife works from home, she is home most of the time with the little one. I live in town house with 3 floors. I have access to outside from the main level. There is no private fenced in yard but plenty of open space in the community. Community allows pets and there are many families with dogs of all sizes and shapes. I am a first time puppy raiser with little experience so a puppy with mild personality will be helpful and prefer a yellow lab. Typical working day starts at 7 AM, preparing for work and preparing boy for school. I and elder son leave home by 8 30. Wife and younger son stay home all day. Son comes back from school at 4 and depending on day of the week attends activities starting from 5 to 7. All are home by 7, then dinner and kids sleep by 9 30.

I keep the same work schedule when I work from home. I can adjust my work schedule to meet the puppy's needs. We usually have a dinner at around 6:00 to 6:30 PM. 3-4 times a week I go to the gym in the evening. On weekends I go kayaking in Southport and also for the last couple of years I am learning to sail."
446, ,0,0,South Western CT,,,,03/09/14,"I work from home on the pc, get up at 6am and begin work at 7:30am and end at 4pm BUT other than market open and close I can be flexible for the puppy's needs especially in the beginning stages. Since we have had dogs, we aren't beginners and since I have attended numerous GEB puppy raising classes in Westport, I'm now familiar with many of the techniques in the why and how of training a GEB dog. Because my schedule can be flexible during the week, I have time to socialize the puppy with various experiences in and out of the house. I walk 3-4 miles daily in all weather and can adjust my walking distance into smaller slices according to the stage/age of the puppy. I'm very familiar with crate training. I take tai chi class or yoga 1 night a week.  It would be very rare even at 4 months of age that the puppy would be left for 4 hours. We're located in a wooded area but we have sections of cleared land with grass, wood chips, gravel, stone surrounding the house.  It's easy to designate an area for get busy. On the weekends, especially in good weather, we're outside gardening, visiting with family who all like dogs, doing errands involving driving to surrounding towns where they have sidewalks and more people.  We also have family in NYC where we have taken our dogs when they were old enough to be exposed.  The car ride and exposure to the noise, people, sounds and smells of the city seem to be good socialization and learning experiences for the dog who might eventually live in a city vs the suburbs. We also have relatives we visit who live at the beach and our dogs always enjoyed it. On weekends in  good weather I play tennis outdoors.  Weekends are active and often we include our dogs with appropriate activities and rest. We live on a quiet dead end road with only a few homes and there are 6 labs and 1 golden who are friendly and well trained. We do not have young kids living at home. Both my husband and I are physically active and always have been, we're in good health and don't have any injuries to prevent us from having an active dog. We don't end our day until 11pm and even later on weekends. I would have to say that during the week, our social life is more limited because of early rising but on weekends we enjoy friends and family at our home or we go out Saturday night. Although this is more of a short story than a novel, I think you can get a fairly good idea of our work schedule. lifestyle, and flexibility. We have traveled quite a lot in the past and at this point because of work obligations, we don't take more than a week ofvacation at any one time.  As for hobbies, I'm an amateur photographer and have done some very good work and I am active in fundraising. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.    As an aside to Maria.... I missed class#1 in Oct because I went away to visit my aunt who was ill but I still came to class 2&3.  I want you to know that the day of this March class #1 my beloved aunt died and it was very tough for me but I still came to class.  Now I'm repeating class 2 and 3. Obviously I take commitment seriously with whatever I do."
447, ,0,0,New York City,,,,03/09/14,"We live on the fifth floor of an elevated condo in Hoboken, NJ with a fenced in yard.  There are three members of our pack, my wife Pam, myself and a 2 1/2 year old miniature Golden Retriever named Luna.  Luna is a spayed female that gets along great with other dogs.  My wife and I both work full time jobs, and I travel about once a month for work during the week.  We are very active with Luna.  During the workweek one or both of us wake about an hour earlier than we did before we had her to take her for a walk, a 3 mile run or to the dog park for her exercise.  If we are both going to the office that day (generally speaking we each work from home 1 day a week), Luna has a dog walker that takes her out for about 45 minutes at around 12 Noon.  If I am not on the road I get home at 5:45 PM to take Luna out again; if I am on the road Pam get home at 6:15 or 6:30 to take Luna out.  The weekends, naturally, are much more fun and we incorporate Luna into most outdoor activities we enjoy.  We've raised Luna to be a good member of society, and keep similar rules and guidelines that 'Guiding Eyes for the Blind' use (i.e. sitting at doors, taking food gently, leaving things that are not dog toys, she‚Äôs not allowed on the furniture, etc).  Our goal, at first, is to volunteer as puppy sitters, learn the program, and help out where we can and then reevaluate over time if being a full-fledged puppy raiser is right for our pack.  Personally, Luna is my 3rd dog and I have been around animals most of my life.  I worked in a pet food, supplies and grooming store when I was younger, and am comfortable with all types of dogs."

Chris and I both work in Manhattan but have flexible work schedules (i.e. can work from home, go into office late, leave early etc.) We work M-F but often times at least 1-2 days from home. Luna, is our 2.5 year old Comfort Retriever (miniature golden) and we do not have children at this time.    M-F , we normally come home from work, cook dinner together, play with Luna and get to bed around 11. We take Luna out in the morning for a walk, run or dog park play and immediately after work and she loves her dog walker that comes mid-day for 30 minutes to walk her and play with her. The weekends are typically busier packed with activities. Hoboken is a very dog friendly town with many parks and ideal or walking around -with a beautiful waterfront promenade we enjoy walking on.  We also take Luna out with us often on routine tasks - shopping, walking, meeting friends, etc. and keep her engaged in routine commands (sitting before entering a door or exiting the building, staying, down, etc.).   We have a car and take Luna with us on road trips or family and friends' homes where she can engage with other dogs, families and small children.   We live in a condo building with 11 other apartments. There are several families with young children that Luna loves to play with - and 2 other dogs besides Luna in the building.   We love to travel and do so often -either together to someplace accessible by car or further. When we travel further, Luna will stay with family members or her dog walker.   We both sometimes have to travel for work and in those instances, the other has to become the primary caretaker and adjust the schedules accordingly to ensure nothing changes for Luna. We also rely on friends and my sister to help out at times when work demands are high. For the most part we have an active yet balanced social life and are looking forward to helping out where we can with puppy sitting!"

My husband and I own a 2-family home, but I currently live alone since we have recently separated (with, unfortunately, little chance of reconciliation).  Our upstairs tenants are a young couple with 2 children ages 12 and 10, as well as a very vocal Manchester Terrier.    Because of my long commute, I am out the door by 6:00 each morning and don't usually get back home until sometime after 5:00 pm.  Most weeks I have many hours of additional planning and grading to do at home.  It is because of my challenging schedule that I have waited until my sabbatical year to raise a puppy.    This coming school year I will be the student rather than the teacher.  I am required to take just 16 total credits during the Fall and Spring semesters, which I will be taking at Westchester Community College.  This will allow me plenty of time to devote to the care and training of a puppy.     I have a close relationship with my mom, 3 sisters and brothers in-law, and my 7 nieces and nephews.  I usually spend a few weekend days a month with them as well as with various friends.  I plan to make them a big part of the socialization of the puppy.  My youngest nephew is 13, the oldest 26, so while my puppy will spend most of its time in a very calm quiet home, it will regularly be exposed to quite busy households as well.    During the summer I generally keep close to home, but I do usually make a couple of driving trips for a couple or 3 weeks.  My mom has a vacation home in Massachusetts where I will no doubt spend some time, and for the last 2 years I've driven south with several family members to spend a week at my cousin's beach house in South Carolina.  Certainly my puppy will be able to join me on these expeditions.  I may take a cruise at some point next year, but not for more than a week.    I'm not sure what else I can tell you, but if you need more information, just ask - I'm an open book."

Other than that, my puppy is allowed to be at work with me and is allowed to be in most of my classes, but I will always check with the professor to see if he or she is alright with me having a puppy in his or her class.  If I cannot bring the puppy with me to class, I will leave him or her with a sitter.  I am free on the weekends, and do not often go away, except to go home on school vacations.

I take Benny out 3-4 times a day, and generally take him for a 1/2 hour walk in late afternoon. I go out many evenings, and tend to go out more than i have people come to the house.     I can make time for a puppy and i think my dog will like having puppies around. he's never met a puppy he didn't like, although there are a couple of dogs in the building and its immediate vicinity that he really dislikes. He gets along with every dog in Central Park and has never been in a dog fight in his life.    Benny adores children and can't get enough of them. He's gentle with them and happily does tricks for them.    I can't bring my dog to my family's home because my nephew is allergic to dogs. My cousin has a Havanese who sometimes stays with us when she travels. She has a house in Pennsylvania with a fenced yard and I think a puppy would like that.    He has one terrible habit, which is barking when the phone rings and when someone comes to the door.  He's a sweet and funny dog.    I am very physically active and walk many miles every day. It's 3 miles round trip to the park and i do that every day before breakfast.    I don't use a dog walker, but know several of them very well and so there are people i could trust if i needed someone to talk a puppy.

Rodney's son Brandon, 27, who came to live with us in December,  is also home most days all days.      Usually I am up by 7 making lunch and seeing Tafari off to school by 7:45. I usually clean one house a day, which takes about 4 hours including travel time to and from. On days when I clean two, I am away for  6-7.5 hours. When I had my golden retriever, Lexi, I took her with me to all my jobs. She always came inside and just laid down or was occasionally left in the car. Both scenarios worked great. I loved having her with me, as did my customers. She was exceptionally well behaved. Prior to cleaning homes I worked at a domestic violence shelter where women and children stayed and she would come to work with me and be a comfort to distressed families.  She was a wonderful dog that I could take anywhere.     After school hours are typically taking my son to tutoring, some type of athletic practice, going to the gym or coming home to do homework. Rodney and I take turns with driving to these various places. Again, one of us is usually home when the other is out. I am home all evenings m-f helping with homework etc. Usually Rodney is as well , and so is  Brandon. Brandon and Rodney are both  home most days all days.  As a family we are rich in people resource but not so much financial resource.     Weekends- Friday nights Rodney and I go out and Tafari spends the night with his father, step mother  and step siblings. Weekends are not  particularly scheduled. I like to rest, read, bike ride, hike, swim or visit friends if I have the energy. We like to travel on weekends when we have money and a place to go. Like visit friends in Blue Hill.     We own and live on  the first floor of a three unit condo building/ association on the corner block of two streets on Munjoy Hill in Portland, Maine. We have a small grass yard, brick patio, grill and a raised bed vegetable garden. Our neighbors one floor above us are a young couple with  a new baby born in  November, and on the third floor is a single women who is a French Professor at Bowdoin. It is very easy to hear foot traffic from outside as well as footsteps and cats running on the floor above us.  There are cats roaming in the streets, and many dogs being walked on leashes going by regularly.     We may rent our home for some amount of time over the summer to make some money. Could be June-August;  or for one or two weeks during the summer; or perhaps just for a few weekends. Still weighing our options at this point. For short term rents of a week if we couldn't take the pup I was thinking a  guiding eyes puppy sitter could take the pup, and if it were for all three months we would only take a place that was suitable for the pup as well. The one place I am considering is a house with a large yard where my son and I lived for 8 months last year in Portland's West End.    I like/need to travel to some place warm for some amount of time in the winter. Winters are a challenge for me.  When it gets cold and dark, so do I. I would like to make a plan to be able to do this next winter.      Our place is about 1350sq/ft, one floor, open design with tall ceilings. A  dog on the small side would be our only preference if possible.     Theses are all the potential things you may want to know about us in regards to our ability to be puppy raisers that I can think of right now. I look forward and am always available and open  to talking more about anything you can think of. Thanks!!!"

Tuesdays and Thursdays I have class until 4:30 and am free afterwards until club meetings from 8-9:30. On Fridays, I work from 10-12 and then have class from 1:50-2:45 and group project from 3-5. On the weekends, I am generally free. It is mostly just hanging out with friends and doing homework. I am able to have a pup with me both at work and in most of my classes, unless there is already a pup in the class."

I live in a dorm, across the hall from another raiser (Chelsea Armlin), and am actively involved on campus. I am transferring to University of Arizona in the fall, but can help with puppies until then. I plan on getting involved down there with their Guide dog program. I am interested in helping puppysit puppies. I have no more than three classes in a row, and can take puppies home with me on breaks. Burlington Vermont has puppy classes on Thursdays as well. I am able to attend all weekly puppy classes too. My mornings are less flexible than my afternoons. I am done usually by 4pm every day. I am very excited to work with GEB!!!

When I am at school on the weekends I usually stay in my dorm. I do not go out to parties. My work schedule is flexible but since I wouldn't be getting the puppy until next semester, I'm sure my schedule is subject to change. Over the summer, I work a part time job at Hannaford and I usually live a pretty active lifestyle."
469, ,0,0,Central CT,,,,02/26/14,"As I am retired, my schedule is very flexible. My current routine is to get up early and ride my horse five mornings a week. In all this takes about three hours during which the puppy could remain at home, crated, or in the car, crated, with or without an opportunity to tour the barn and meet horses, dogs, and people.     Doing errands, gym, or a dinner with non-dog friends, a downstairs neighbor and my landlord next door can almost always offer a caring voice at hand.    I live in a rural area with cats, chickens and sometimes cows or dogs as well as hundreds of undeveloped acres of fields and woods with deer, turkeys, etc. Old logging trails make for excellent walks. I have access to a large private pond with a gently sloping beach for getting used to water and accustomed to seeing people in and around water. (Do on-duty guide dogs ever swim with their owners?)     ‚ÄúTown‚Äù is 15 minutes away with traffic, sidewalks, children, stores. I go to New York once or twice a month and could schedule a trip to introduce the puppy to riding on Metro North, walking in intense pedestrian and car traffic. Riding in buses and cabs or even riding the subway if that is appropriate.     I‚Äôve taught two puppies to make the transition from ‚ÄúGet Busy‚Äù on grass to stepping off the curb between parked cars and could certainly try again.    Most evenings are spent quietly at home or at dinner close to home. Understanding friends will almost all invite a puppy along.     In all, there is a great deal to discover and enjoy in my life. I hope to have puppies to share it with."
470, ,0,0,Leatherstocking,,,,02/25/14,"Well I currently am living on campus in college. I want to co-raiser with my roommate. It is a dog friendly campus, there are other raisers here as well. My roommate and I have looked at our schedules and have figured out how we would share time with our puppy. I work as a night host in my dorm building.So when the puppy needs to go out at night I can be able to take the puppy out. In our dorm building there is another GEB raiser so I think it would be great that out puppies will have play dates.When I go home for breaks, either my roommate or I will take the puppy home. Back at home I live in Queens, NY in a house. In my house; there is my mom, dad, brother and two uncles. We all love dogs, we personally don't have any pets because of our work schedules. But I have spoken to my family and they love the fact that I might raise a GEB dog because they know how much I love to give back to the community and they also believe that it is a great way to be even more responsible than what I really am. They have said that they will help me out with the rules that the GEB program has provided me with but that at the end of the day it is all my responsibility which I completely understand and I think I will do a great job with. So between the help of my family, GEB and my roommate I feel that being a first time puppy raiser it won't be as complicated and I will know who I can ask for help if I do need help with my puppy."
472, ,0,0,Leatherstocking,,,,02/24/14,"As a college student, my weeks are pretty repetitive. I have classes from 9:05-11:05 on Mondays and then I am doing homework the rest of the day with one meeting in the evenings. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have class 10-12 and then 2:30-3:50. I have another meeting in the evenings on Tuesdays. On Wednesdays and Fridays, I have class from 9:05-11:05 and again from 12:20-1:40. My work schedule is relatively flexible and I can have a dog with me while at work. I work about 8 hours a week. While doing homework, I am in my room or in a close-in lounge by myself so I would be able to have a dog with me during those times as well. Some of my professors in classes allow students to bring their dog with them to class and if not, there are often sitters on campus that will take the dog so it is not left in its kennel all day long. My weekends are completely free. I go to the store on Friday or Saturday nights every other week or once every three weeks. Besides that, I just take walks on the weekend and do homework and relax. I am very active and love to take long walks just to appreciate the world around me. I make plenty of time to enjoy the outdoors, but also spend time inside while doing homework. Besides my classes, my schedule is fairly flexible and I am willing to accommodate the needs of a dog to fit into that schedule.        At Hartwick, we have the option to be puppy sitters and for now, that is what I would like to do, but I would like to co raise with another student if that option because available to me. It would be difficult to take a dog home with me during the summer because I work a lot of hours at an animal shelter and because my two dogs at home can be high-strung at times so I would not want my pup to pick up any bad habits that would inhibit their ability to succeed in the program. I have been working on improving my dog's obedience and manners so with more improvement, bringing a Guiding Eye's puppy into the house during the summer vacation could be an option and I would be willing to raise if the pup by myself as long as it would not be taught poor behavior by my dogs."

She LOVES animals just as much, but is definitely not a hunter. Both kids have grown up with a dog as we had Laddie before they were born. At this point, my husband and I aren't ready for the full time commitment in raising a dog, but would love the companionship of a dog/puppy and want to assist in building responsibility that comes along with raising a dog with the kids.

I also spend a good deal of time gardening.      Before moving to Old Lyme, I lived in New York City for most of my life.  My boyfriend, Skip Roessel, still has an apartment in New York City, and I visit him there around once a month. He visits my house quite frequently.  Skip is willing learn about and adhere to Guiding Eyes' puppy raising guidelines, but I would be the main caretaker.  We both have relatives in Virginia and we visit them at least three times each year.  We take trains whenever possible.  Our extended families are very dog-oriented, and so are many of our old friends.    I am not particularly social but am willing to make a big effort go get a puppy socialized.      My biggest concern in fostering a Guiding Eye puppy (or any puppy) is how to make sure that the puppy gets enough exercise. I love to walk and was often the designated dog walker for my extended family's dogs.  However, I now have mild trouble with my hip which acts up if I consistently walk more than a few miles each day. This makes me reluctant to commit to full time puppy fostering.  I can easily do the necessary walking for a few days or weeks as a puppy sitter.      I love dogs and bought my home partly with an eye on having a good arrangement for a dog."

Many neighbors have dogs. Lots of sidewalks and parks with trails nearby for walking. Red line metro 15 minutes walk or 3 minute drive away. Opportunities to ride the metro and bus are possible.

We like heading out for food, shopping and culture. Sometimes early morning car shows on Saturday or Sunday brunch. Some days are reserved for more mundane chores like cleaning and laundry. We enjoy vacations and like to travel although it doesn't happen as often as we would like. Last year a few of our highlights were spending a week in the Outer Banks, whitewater rafting in North Carolina, cave touring and offroading in West Virginia. I also spent 2 weeks in India for training and vacation.

We are both mostly home during the day - except for errands - in  which case one of us is normally here.  We seldom go out in the evening and if we do, it is for an early dinner right here in the neighborhood.  We are both animal lovers and have had dogs for over 35 years.  The only limitation we might have would be lifting over 50# individually - although together we could get the job done.  We have a 4 yr. old grandson who spends the night on a weekend but he is very gently with our dogs and has a dog and cat of his own.  He would not be a problem. We also have a home at the Outer Banks in North Carolina that we usually go to in the spring and fall.  Dogs are allowed on the beach (on leash only of course) during those times of the year.

I have a pleathera of animals to expose the puppy to including rabbits, chickens, ducks, goats, cats, and cows.  I have been a puppy raiser 2 times before with CCI, but my firend Faith Styles has convinced me that Guiding Eyes for the Blind is a better organization to go with, and I must agree that there is more organization and support for the puppy raisers with Guiding Eyes for the Blind than with CCI.  I have a simple IT desk job in Quantico, so when the puppy receives his/her cape, he/she would be exposed to a lot of different people, but also taught the skill of quietly laying under a desk for instances like Dr.'s appointments and such, or even on the job if the person they are paired up with has a desk job.  On the weekends I can get really busy running errands, but the puppy would come with me.  Whether it be grocery shopping, Lowe's or Petsmart shopping, going to a friends house, or work on the farm, there are numerous situation beneficial to the socialization of a puppy.

I currently have a 16 year old Pomeranian, so don't want to raise a puppy full time until she passes which looks to be pretty close now :(  Since it's been several years since raising a service dog, and you would be a whole new organization I think it might be better after attending all 4 puppy placement classes to do the Home Swap, or boarding for Puppy Raisers going on vacation before actually getting a puppy to raise myself.  That's all the specific details I can readily think of, but if you require anything else don't hesitate to contact me.  I cannot have my phone with me at work, so email usually is the best, or just leave a message, and I'll get back to you.

512, ,0,0,,,,,11/07/13,I am a nurse anesthetist and work 45 hours plus during the week. I am signing up to be a puppy sitter for the free time I have on weekends. I also will be able to take a puppy when I am home and on vacation. I live with my 16 year old daughter and our 5 year old cat. We live in the City of Albany where there are plenty of sidewalks. I walk daily for exercise and envision being able to do so with a puppy. I have been exposed to dogs all my life as we had multiple canines growing up and my parents have had dogs up until three years ago. I also worked in my Dad's animal hospital while I was in high school and college.  I realize that I do not have the time to raise a puppy on a full time basis but was thrilled to hear that puppy sitting was an option. Eventually I would like to raise a guiding eye puppy but getting my feet wet with shorter time periods works well for me given my time availability.
514, ,0,0,,,,,11/06/13,I have plenty of time to take care of a puppy; prefer to sit one first; prefer house trained.  No problems with spending lot of time with puppy.

For the next year or so, we plan to stay fairly close to home.  We will be out of the house for three to five hours at a time in the coming months depending on the needs of the puppy.  We in live in a twin home.  We are attached to another house in a neighborhood of twin homes.  We own our house and land but do not have a fenced yard.  This is a great area for walking, meeting and greeting the neighbors, and meeting other dogs.  The center of downtown Troy is three to five miles away.  Our home is about 2100 sq. ft. with three floors of living space.  Most of the living is on the first floor.  The puppy can learn to use the stairs.  With hardwood floors and some carpeting, the puppy can learn about different surfaces.  We have a small dog (10.5 lbs.) that is 2.5 years old.  He is outgoing and friendly.  He is good with people, children, cats, and dogs.  We are experienced dog and cat owners.  We  need a small and calm puppy.  The sex and color of the puppy does not matter."

Wake up 6AM (may decide to wake up earlier on puppy days).  Weekdays leave for school drop-off by 7:30AM and puppy will be crated.  Weekends free in morning.  Weekdays nanny (who also loves dogs and has worked with them) will come by 10:30AM to take puppy for a walk, spend time with puppy, until nanny leaves for school pick-up at 1:30-2:30PM, depending on the day.  Puppy will be crated for school pick-up.  Nanny will come home with my daughter at 3:30-4:30PM, depending on when she left.  I will join them at dinner time.  My daughter is asleep by 8PM.  I am up much later usually and will take the puppy out to go to the bathroom before bedtime.  Puppy will be crated overnight.

This is not flexible and I work about 30min from the apartment. I am also in graduate school Wednesday nights and clinical usually Mondays from 7-7. After December I will return to a ""normal"" M-F schedule, but still with little flexibility and the same commute. At that point I will have time to take the dog out in the mornings and evenings and play with him more in the evenings and on weekends. Our weekends will be pretty flexible. Until then, Tameron will be doing 85% of the puppy duties.   We like to get out and about, we do lots of walking around the city (often long distances) and take the subway frequently. We also like to travel, although that doesn't happen as much as we'd like right now. We are not planning any big trips in the next year, likely 5-6 days tops.  We hope to have a baby while the puppy is with us, but unless he/she is extremely advanced, he/she will not be mobile while we have the puppy."

We have 3 children ages 12 (Stanley), 10 (Zoe) and 7 (Nate).  We also have a cat (Edward).  A typical day: I get up and then wake the kids and help them to get ready. Then I make their breakfasts and pack lunch.  Then I walk Nate about 1/2 mile each way to school.  I walk back home and walk Stanley and Zoe the 4 blocks to their school.  Then I either run errands or come home and do work (which is paperwork or phone calls), and housework. Sometimes I meet a friend for lunch. At 2:35, I pick up Nate and take him to the playground for about 30 minutes, then we pick up Stanley and Zoe.  Each day I usually walk one of the kids to an after school (the walk is about 12 blocks). The kids do homework in the afternoons. They usually have friends over once a week and the kids play on the computer, or play legos, or occasionally have a nerf gun battle in the living room.  They go to sleep between 7:40 and 9:40. I usually go to sleep by 11 and Jeff is a night owl, sometimes doing work on the computer in bed. Jeff works at home.  He sometimes gets up early with everyone else and then might go back to bed. He spends the day in his home office - on the computer and making phone calls.  He also does pick-ups and drop-offs of the kids if I have a conflict or a school meeting.     We live on the first floor and basement floor of a 5-floor walk up. There are a few other dogs in the building.  On weekends, we sometimes go to a museum or other event or go out for lunch. Sometimes we hang around at home and read, or bake or do crafts, watch tv or play on the computer.  We have a weekend house in New Paltz, NY. We go up for school vacations and occasional weekends.  We may bike or hike while up there, but usually keep it short. We have stairs (not a given for new york city) and our house is a bit of a mess."

I do therapy exercises daily and I go to acupuncture weekly. I don't normally have much trouble with back spasms, but when the weather changes sometimes the spasms increase and worsen. I get my teeth cleaned twice a year and see my family Dr. twice a year or as needed if I'm sick. I do almost all of the shopping, so I do go out a few times a week for short times either in the early am or in the afternoon. I am not working at the present time. I stay home and care for my husband's Mother who is 91 years old. I am a LPN Licensed Practical Nurse since 1984. I have worked full time with as much overtime as I could get since 1975 until 2006 when I became unable to work due to my neck. I have 2 grown children, 31 and 25 years of age, who no longer live at home.I also have a 3 1/2 year old Granddaughter who lives next door, but next door is about 1,000 feet. My Granddaughter come to visit about once or twice a week and she loves dogs and animals. She is very calm and doesn't run around inside the house, we go outside to do that. I don't have any other close neighbors the next neighbor is down the road a few 1,000 feet. I have an 8 year old dog his Mother was a Black Lab and his Father was a Shar-pei.He loves all dogs, gets a long with all he has met and is very well behaved. Anyone including my Granddaughter and the cats or another dog can go into his food dish while he is eating, but we don't encourage this. I have 3 cats that go outside; 1 likes dogs, the other 2 don't, they all get along with my dog. I live in a 3 story house with 2 flights of straight stairs. There are 11 rooms and 3 full baths, one on each floor. The house is about 700 feet from the road with lawn between. The back is an incline up a small mountain filled with woods. I wake up between 5 and 6 am and I go to sleep around midnight. I have 4 hours of free time in the am, till my Mother-in-law wakes up and I help her with her breakfast. Twice a week I help her through mid afternoon with personal care. The rest of the day is free to do house chores or what ever I want to do until 4 pm when I make dinner. Some days I have dinner leftovers so I don't have to cook. My husband comes home from work any time after 4 pm mostly before 6 pm unless he is working out of town then it could be 9 pm or 10 pm. He does over night work 3 -4 days about 4 times a year and sometimes I get the opportunity to go with him. Weekends are the same and as free as the rest of my week. Occasionally I get to go away with my husband, but since last year when his Mom moved in with us, we don't go away as much. Short day trips are all we do and we may leave around 10 am and the latest we will return home is around 7 pm. The evenings are spent watching movies or sitting outside or doing something crafty. We don't have as much company now that my husband's Mom is living with us as we did before. Once a month we have family or friends come visit over night. All of them live 100s of miles away, so that is why they stay with us. All my friends and family like dogs and other animals. I hope this information is helpful."

We would do it well.  We are training oriented with Finn.  One reason we want to wait until the spring before committing to 18 months of puppy raising is that we want Finn to complete canine good citizens training first.  We love dogs and love labs.

571, ,0,0,,,,,08/14/13,"A bit about me and my living situation:  I live with my landlady in the middle of a row of townhouses in the NW quarter of D.C. I have my own bedroom, living room and bathroom while we share the kitchen/dining room/patio/porch/fenced in backyard/ and attic. The block has on-street parking and is a main vein that runs from MD to DC. However, it is not as busy at Georgia Ave NW which runs parallel to my street. The neighbors are quiet but plentiful. One family has a mariachi band and they sometimes practice in the evening. There are a good amount of dogs that live on the block and in the neighborhood. Some are well behaved and others are constantly barking in their back yard or pulling hard on their leashes. Some neighbors are foreign and have a fear of dogs; they will avoid walking near you on the sidewalks. There are a couple bus stations, schools and churches around my neighborhood.   My landlady owns a 12lb bichon mix 3 year old female dog who we have had for 2.5 years. She is spoiled but very gentle and submissive. She is usually not interested in new dogs and will take a while to warm up to new additions. Usually she ignores them unless they are in her space. She will also bark loudly if there is a knock or sound at the door, even if it is clearly me using my key to enter the house. My landlord just recently got a new puppy from a bad situation (he was neglected along with his sibling in an abandoned apartment; his sibling did not make it.) He is a 35lb soon to be neutered male pit/boxer mix, maybe 8 months old. He is very goofy, still learning how big his body is, very playful, a little nippy/mouthy and very connected to my landlady. She says he will be going into puppy training after he recovers from his surgery in late August.  I myself like to keep busy. Ever since my dog passed away a little over a year ago, I have been filling the void by rarely spending too much time at home. I try and excerise more than I have been in the past year and I tend to visit with friends or go to concerts more often. I haven‚Äôt been ready for my own dog just yet and I feel that sitting puppies for GEB will fill a doggy void in my life. Unfortunately, my boss did not approve of raising a puppy for GEB as it maybe too distracting to have such a young dog to care for and train while simultaneously working.    Typical day:  Wake up around 8 or 8:30am, shower, dress, eat breakfast, check emails, grab packed lunch  Go to work 9 or 9:30am  Break 11am (10-15min if needed or there is time)  Lunch 1pm (30min)  Break 4pm (if needed or there is time)  Out at 5:30 6pm    Mondays and Thursdays (in a perfect world) leave from work and go to the gym 6:30-7:30 with a couple friends carpooling. After gym drop off friends at their homes. Go home make dinner 7:45-8pm. Chill out watch tv catch up with social media etc bedtime around 10-midnight. (I say in a perfect world because sometime Mondays can be very action packed and physically exhausting so I skip gym in favor of errands or chill out time.)    Tuesdays come home from work make dinner 6-6:30pm, laundry/cleaning/tv chill out with light exercise.  Every other Tuesday is trivia night at a local bar in Takoma Park MD from 5:30-8pm.    Wednesdays dinner at my dad‚Äôs apartment 6:30-10 or 10:30pm. Go home bedtime 11 or 1130pm. (Now with classes on Wednesdays, dad dinner date has been switched to Thursdays and gym to Fridays)    Fridays either leave town to visit friends or family or go to a special event (a lot of weddings and a couple camping trips happened this summer) Visiting family includes driving 6 hours to upstate NY while stopping at a diner for dinner. Or, going up to Harper‚Äôs Ferry to visit my boyfriend for the weekend. Or, staying home and hanging out. Or going to dinner with friends. Or going to see a concert.      Usually my weekends are packed with weekend excursions or traveling somewhere or day trips. If I am in Harper‚Äôs Ferry I will take about a 5 mile hike on flat terrain or a shorter hike on hilly terrain after a lunch around noon or 1pm.   I am willing to simplify my schedule to accommodate any of the pup‚Äôs needs. However, if my nana or grandfather fell ill in upstate NY I will be driving up there to help my family on the weekends.    My work is usually Monday through Friday 10-6 or 9-5 depending when I come in. However, we are a theatre and go into tech months/weeks where my schedule is shifted drastically.   Tech week schedule:  Wake up 4:30am, dress, grab granola bar or piece of fruit on the way out the door  5am Drive to work, pick up the work van, drive to the Kennedy Center, pick up the costumes (anywhere form 1-3 bushel hampers full of clothes) drive back to the Takoma Studio, check in the items, secure the building go home to nap 7:30am. 10am wake up shower, dress, eat breakfast. 11am back at work to either drive more costumes down to the theater or go about normal business. Lunch 1pm. Drive costumes back to the theater 2pm. Drive back to the studio and work as normal until 5:30pm. Go home eat dinner 6pm. Early bedtime 9pm.  I will have to look up on the work calendar when exactly these hectic times come up. We usually produce 2 shows in the fall, 1 around December holidays, and 2 in the spring."

I could take the pup out during these times.  I am not intimidated by adverse weather and like to be outside the entire year.  I live in a subberb and we have a downtown area which is often busy with lots of activity.  I have a home and a yard which is rather small and not fenced in.  Summer weekends are often spent at my camp whch is about 90 miles from my home.  This is in a rural area with a lake and forested area."
574, ,0,0,,,,,08/13/13,"Daily schedule:  I wake up at 6am, use the restroom, get dressed, and take my dog, Bean (an 8 year old neutered male Boston Terrier) out to do his business and for a short walk.  I feed Bean at 7am, eat my breakfast, enjoy some quality time with Bean, and get organized for the day.  At 8am I leave for work.  I return home around 12:30pm (this time is flexible) to take Bean out to do his business and for a short walk.  I feed Bean his lunch at 1pm (Bean eats three small meals a day for medical reasons).  At around 1:30pm (this time is flexible) I return to work.  I come home again around 5pm (this time is flexible), I walk Bean, play with Bean, and prepare/eat my dinner.  I feed Bean his dinner at 7pm, spend quality time with Bean, do paperwork, read a book or watch T.V., etc.  I often have a bath at around 9pm.  At around 10pm, I take Bean out one last time to do his business, then we both turn in for the night.  I work 2 miles from home, so it doesn't take me more than 5 minutes to commute each way.  Currently, I work a slightly longer block of hours in the morning than in the afternoon, but I can adjust my lunch break so that the puppy isn't alone for more than 4 hours at a time.  My weekend schedule is very similar to my weekday schedule, except that I don't go to work, so I am home for longer stretches at a time (I generally go out in the late morning and/or mid-afternoon to run errands, but I have a good amount of down time on the weekends).    Matching me with a puppy: I have no breed preference or coat-color preference.  If possible, I would prefer to be matched with a female pup because I think that my dog, Bean, being male, will likely have an easier time with a female, especially as the pups will be intact through adolescence and into young adulthood.  Bean is outgoing and I'm confident he will accept the puppy, regardless of gender, but I think he will warm more readily to a female pup.    Upcoming events:  I have a business trip to California coming up in late October.  I will be home on the weekends, so I won't miss any classes, but I will be gone for most of one work week (Mon 10/21 - Thu 10/24).  I'm hoping that the business trip won't be a problem (it is an annual event and not something that I can get out of); hopefully, it will be possible to arrange for a Guiding Eyes volunteer puppy sitter during the dates that I have to be away.    Thank you for considering me to be a puppy raiser for Guiding Eyes.  I look forward to the experience of helping to raise one of your amazing pups!"

There is not a lot of traffic, but the cars do sometimes go fast .  Therefore, allowing a pup a lot of leash on a neighborhood walk might not be safe.  There is a village to walk around with more level ground and no speeding cars.  Sidewalk walking is possible if we take a 20 minute drive to a neighboring town.  That is not a problem at all.  We depend on the surrounding towns for many of our needs.        We are not away often overnight and have no travel plans in the near future.  We are mostly at home, except for daily trips to do errands and for some medical and dental appointments.  Daily trips are usually about 2 hours.  That includes travel time to and from.  My best guess is that once a week we may have an appointment that would take us away 4-6 hours.  Weekends are usually planned with friends or family. Once a month we might be out of town for the entire day for an occasion or activity.  The pup could be involved with some of these events, but not every one.        In terms of sex of the dog, I have no preference. I love to walk and would not have an issue walking three miles a day.  My husband thinks that females might be complicated.  I love all color dogs, but since we live in an area with a large deer and tick population, I think it would be easier to spot a tick on a dog with a light colored coat.       My final thought is that we are trying to gather as much information and experience as possible in order to be well prepared for success.  I would feel most comfortable perhaps beginning with a puppy sitting experience prior to becoming a puppy raiser."

Two college students who are home during the summer, a 15 year old (puppy raiser), a 12 year old (all four are girls), Mom, Dad and 82 year old grandma.  We live on a ""gentlemen's farm"", with tortoises, rabbits, horses and two dogs (a ten year female german shepherd who is starting to show her age, sleeps a lot and doesn't move fast and a 4 year old westie, female who still thinks she is a puppy and drives our shepherd crazy because she doesn't want to play as much, both fixed).  Our entire 5 acres is fenced in with underground fencing so the dogs both run free but we do understand that the puppy must be on leash at all times, except when we put her in our little puppy yard that we used to set up for the shepherd and westie when they were pups.  I (mom), works out of the home with some field work required, but we strongly believe in crating as our dogs love their crates and the westie still sleeps in it at night and during the day when she needs a break from everyone. We will crate the puppy a few times a day to make it a ""fun place"" to be and of course at night, but the rest of the time she will be under close watch of the family in a fenced in puppy area in the middle of our main floor area (we live in a post and beam home and the first floor is all open).  Dad works full time 7 to 4:00 out of the house, grandma comes and goes as she pleases. The two younger girls are in school now but will be home during the summer.

My weekends are filled with free time that will be devoted to the pup...My house is in Syracuse so it will be easy for me to attend weekly classes at GEB sites in Cuse when im home on breaks.

They also host holidays and other celebration celebrations we don't go that often but when we have we have always taken our current dogs who both enjoy it and seem to have a good time.

After I get a little bit of experience puppy sitting and with the rules and procedures of Guiding Eyes I would like to raise or co raise a puppy. My boyfriend who is neither a Cornell or IC student but lives here locally would also like to get involved so we would like to see if he could eventually take the class as a community member and become certified by Guiding Eyes to also be a sitter/puppy raiser.

Because I live on a college campus, the puppy will receive a variety of experiences. I am a little overly conscience of the puppy whining if he/she hears people in the hall when I am not around and becomes noisy. This could become a major problem.

I spend at least part of each day at a barn caring for horses and teach therapeutic horse back riding to individuals with disabilities 4 days a week for 4 hours at a time.  The pup would come with me and I would set up a crate when I cannot directly supervise the pup and give it my  undivided attention.  The circumstances will provide opportunities for me to appropriately introduce the pup to lots of people, many with different types of disabilities.    I spend a few hours each day doing office work at home to run the business.    I sometimes have meetings/appointments and have to be away from home for a few hours. Would crate dog at home -- unless it was appropriate for me to bring dog and treat as socialization opportunity.    My 2 dogs are older so cannot go for long walks/rigorous outings anymore -- so pup exercising would be done one on one.

853, ,0,0,,,,,10/09/12,"The Blechman family consists of 2 adults and a 27 month old Labrador Retriever. I work 24 hours over 4 days as a Public Services Assistant at the Hartwick College Library. My work hours are: Mondays & Tuesdays from 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. with a 1 hour lunch break; (I live 3 miles from work and go home for lunch.) Wednesdays and Thursdays from 4 p.m. - 11 p.m. Once or twice a month I also work Sundays from 12 - 5 p.m. which makes that a 29 hour week. My work hours are best described as inflexible but my manager does make allowances for varying my lunch time and is a dog lover. More importantly, well behaved dogs are allowed in the library and GEB pups are welcomed with open arms. I would be able to bring a GEB pup to work with me. (There are GEB dogs being raised on campus.) And finally, my schedule is based on the Hartwick academic calendar so there are 1-3 week breaks during the school year with June, part of July and August off.     My husband is a professor at SUNY-Oneonta teaching meteorology classes during the day so he is home on the evenings when I work.     Buckeye is our recareered neutered male 81 pound yellow Lab. His litter was bred by the Indiana Canine Assistance Network (ICAN). At 8 weeks he went to the North Star Foundation (Storrs, CT) as a puppy candidate for an autistic child. He grew too big and at 5 months moved to a second foster home to see if he would be suitable as a service dog for a disabled vet. Once again, not the career for him, so at 9 months he began his family dog career when we adopted him. He passed his CGC and TDI tests in November 2011. He is a reading program therapy dog at a local school, takes agility classes and currently is taking a class to be a therapy dog at Bassett hospital in Cooperstown. Buckeye serves as our personal trainer, walking one of us a minimum of 2 miles in the morning before breakfast band the other one at least 2 miles in the afternoon rain or shine, wind or snow. Buckeye gets along well with other dogs. His enthusiastically happy impulse control has greatly improved from when we first got him. It is still a work in progress.  He is finally out of the chewing phase (though leather is too tempting) and just this past month is able to have a mat in his crate. He plays hard like a typical Lab, but in short bursts. He has privileges that a GEB pup cannot enjoy: access to the sofa, limited house freedom when we're not home, bully sticks and soft toys. We would follow the GEB rules for the puppy and modify the Buckeye rules as needed such as soft toys.     Days and life style for the Blechman household tend to be slower paced, low stress, well coordinated to accommodate everyone‚Äôs needs and arranged around making sure Buckeye gets plenty of walking exercise. 10,000 steps a day is a piece of cake for our family.    A typical work day is walk Buckeye, eat breakfast, go to work, return from work, house activities, errands, Buckeye skill practice, walk Buckeye, dinner, evening activities.  Two days a week he has a dog skills class and an hour of reading therapy dog duty. Weekends are less structured and more spontaneous with longer walks. Most activities are centered on the home. Occasional trips are taken to visit family.     We live in a rural area which is best described as country suburban rather than out in the sticks. Wildlife abounds including deer, turkeys, chipmunks, squirrels, beaver, fox, mice, voles, and groundhogs to name a few. Domesticated critters include horses, chickens, exotic ducks, turkeys, goats, alpacas, a wide variety of dogs, and even a zebra. Dog walks go over hill and dale along our road and on the many trails in the woods. Sidewalks are just 2.5 miles away in the residential areas, downtown and on the two local college campuses. There are seasonal celebrations in the parks and downtown which we attend ranging from the Halloween parade to 4th of July activities and a hot air balloon festival. We also visit our adult children in Boston, MA and Wilmington, DE. At this time there are no grandchildren in the mix.     I have applied to be a puppy sitter since this ""part-time"" job is the best fit to meet the needs of our young adult Lab. The breaks between sitting will keep us energetic and enthusiastic.  Also, I would be a convenient pup sitter for the Hartwick GEB pups either at my home or while I am working in the Hartwick library."

If the school will not allow me to have the pup in the school I have already made it clear that this is my priority and am prepared to vacate my position. (I alreay retired once in 2006, my aid position is just a way to fill my days and to use my previous skills to help students with educational needs).   I plan to stay in my home for at least the next 3 years, then will likely move to a senior community which will allow me to continue to raise guide dog pups.

I work in consulting for IBM, so I sometimes have to travel, and can get assigned to projects where I have to be out of town Monday-Thursday and back in DC Friday-Sunday for several months at a time.  This uncertainty regarding work is what is keeping me from committing to a puppy.  I am expecting a change in my work location at the beginning of November, and I will have a better sense then of how long the new schedule will last.  But, it likely won't last for the 16-18 months that raising a guide dog requires.  So at this point I see my options as puppy sitting for raisers as needed, and coming to classes, but not getting a puppy.      If not for the uncertainty about my work schedule I would absolutely take a puppy when they become available in November.  I raised 5 Guide dogs previously, and miss both the trying and rewarding experiences that comes with.  My normal schedule is to wake up around 7:45, take my foster dog from the Humane Society out for a walk and feed her breakfast (she's only a temporary foster while she recovers from hip surgery), leave for work about 8:15am.  Be at work from 8:45am-4:45pm, and arrive home about 5:00pm.  I take the foster dog out for a walk when I get home at 5:00pm, then feed her dinner and go to the gym for an hour and a half around 6:30pm.  I come home from the gym and have dinner, and then watch TV and/or respond to emails from about 9:00pm to 11:00pm.

I am in excellent health, have no financial challenges, and have no plans to change careers or to move in the near future.   My biggest concern is that I dont have anyone to do a mid day crate relief. I live 30 minutes from work.   (I do have a roommate, but have not asked for a committment from him on this).   Because of this,  I want to start swapping and puppy sitting asap.   My goal, though, is to foster at some point---sooner rather than later.     I have an older golden retvr who is has excellent house and community manners.  She goes with me anytime it's appropriate.   She travels with me, and much of my free time is spent giving her experiences that she enjoys (new parks, watering holes, camping, visiting new towns).     I have a strong foundation in behavioralism.  I understand the principles of behavior modification.  I have fostered stray dogs who have been able to learn basic skills which enabled them to find loving homes.          So generally speaking, I am a good candidate to foster.  The details of mid-day relief will need attention.   Im ready to devote a significant amount of time and effort to the pup."

902, ,0,0,,,,,08/23/12,"I am going to break this out into a few categories - hopefully will help!    WORK:I work in the development office of an all girls catholic school in Park Slope Brooklyn. My office is a three room office in the convent (separate from the school) on the first floor with plenty of windows and light (and AC).  There are three older nuns who live in the convent (one who happens to watch her niece's labs in long island!) and two others who love dogs. I have an assistant who works in the room next to mine. My office is on the main floor of the convent so lots of outside noise (from hospital down the block) and students coming out of building). I can bring the dog in the school but I do not have to. We also have events in the school where I can bring the dog - there are ONLY stairs in the school - no elevators. There is also a church and we have mass about once a month and I would bring the dog to mass. While we do not have sports events at school (except basketball in the late fall) - I can bring the dog to those events.  In addition, there are some weekend events (I can share the schedule) that I attend and would bring the dog for exposure.  I have my own schedule - some days I need to be in at 8 am and other days - I can be in at 9 am. I leave between 430 and 6pm. My lunch break is usually around 1230.  I eat in the kitchen of the convent. There is a park less than a block from the school where I can bring the dog. Unfortunately, the neighborhood is FULL of dogs.  Work can be busy at times but never when i cant get away to be with the dog (its the advantage of working in the school).     Home life: I live 30 minutes from school walking (all near the park). I also have the subway or bus which i take (depends on weather). I usually get up about 615 or 645‚Ä¶but i know with dogs - its 545‚Ä¶i sublet in a building that allows dogs (and there are quite a few) on the first floor. I take three stairs from the entrance to get to my apt (L shaped studio)‚Ä¶and live two blocks from a park. I have a 6 year old cat named enzo who I adopted as a kitten and is neutered and declawed (his previous owners declawed him). Enzo is my baby and allows me to pick him up, cuddle and I also taught him to sit when he eats.  His litter is in a closet now and will be cornered off when the dog is here. I have air conditioning in my apt and two windows which look out onto the street /entrance of building. Neighborhood is quiet but you can hear the children in building leaving for school in mornings. My schedule now without a dog is that I am up early, I go for a run in the park , shower and head to work.  I know that this changes with a dog. I have a boyfriend but he does not live with me or spends time in apt (he has his own place). We have discussed this and he would stay at my place when I have dog (I would not bring the dog to his apt). He  likes dogs and understands and supports what I am getting involved in.   When I get home from work - I usually cook dinner, feed cat, watch tv and play with enzo. I also go on the computer and check emails.      My weekends are usually quiet. I go for runs, spend time with my parents dogs, have dinner with my boyfriend and watch tv. I also like to go shopping, visit weekend markets (like brooklyn flea, farmers markets) and go food shopping. I sometimes have dinner plans with friends on a Thurs or friday night. (guess that isnt quite the weekend!). OH and I also like to bake.     My parents live less than 10 minutes away (walking) and would be my help in case of anything.     I am pretty active - I enjoy running and walking and listening to music (my singing is something poor enzo has endured for years!). I also am a big sports fan and usually attend a couple of sporting events a year. I also go to the gym when I cant run outside. I have a YMCA in between my apt and work with a track. (actually at my old gym - there was  a blind man who worked out on a treadmill with his dog by his side). I also sometimes take a spin class on Tuesday nights.     I guess its good but most of schedule is flexible! I do not have a car so rely on my parents to get me around but I am subway rider (always have been).  I have two sisters but do not see them often. One had a dog and both have cats (their schedules do not match up with mine).     I cant think of anything else but if I do - I will let you know. And if you need my school events schedule please let me know! The only day that I am completely unavailable is Oct 13-14. I am running a huge event at my school and am also watching my parents dogs (its going to be a busy one for me!). Thankfully I live close enough to do both. :) Thanks!!"

Occasionally I do have to stay longer, but in these cases, I can definitely come back for another 30 minutes or so in the evening (around 5pm). I plan to be able to take the pup for a longer walk in the evening, combining this with any grocery shopping or other errands (45 minutes to an hour). Since I mostly have dinner at home, I can supervise the puppy and practice new/old skills from when I'm back until bed time, which is usually around 11:30-12:00pm. Occasionally, I go to the gym for about an hour in the evening, and expect to crate the puppy during this time too. I do not have enough space to have a crate in my bedroom, so the pup will be in the adjacent living room at night. My weekends are a lot more flexible. I typically only work an hour or 2 on weekends. Usually, I spend the weekend over at my girlfriend's apartment, so I plan on taking the puppy and the crate with me to her place during this time.

My family has always had very calm, well-behaved dogs and this is what I am used to.  I believe that my dogs behave the way that they do largely because we train them, but also because the breed (chow chows) are not very active in the first place.  I am not sure if it is even possible to predict puppies that might be more calm, but if so I think that a calm temperament is something that would work best for me!

We could just as easily walk in town or up and down our street.     I expect the puppy's crate will be kept in the room with my desk (which is also the family room).  I plan to have a baby gate to keep the puppy contained in that area most of the time as it is a room that is most consistently in use.      We don't have any children at home.  Our current family includes 3 cats that are not used to dogs.  This is one reason we plan to use the baby gates -- to ease the tension that the cats might experience.

1027, ,0,0,,,,,03/24/12,"A typical day for us starts around 5 for my husband and 6-6:30 for me.  Scott leaves around 5 to get to the gym and then work.   I get my girls ready for school and take them to and from activities (one is in school 5 days the other 3 days).  Non-flexible schedule events are school and activities.  We take one daughter to the bus stop each morning at 7:20 and she gets home at 11:10 (next year will be later).  The other daughter is driven to school at 9:00 and picked up at 11:30.  In the later afternoon we usually have at least one activity to go to.  (this happens usually  3 weekdays afternoons and changes with the season - ballet, soccer, swim, piano, etc),  We have both girls in bed between 7:30 and 8 pm and then go to bed around 10:30 ourselves.  This is a basic schedule, obviously it will change over the summer.  We have a neighborhood pool and spend a lot of time there.  We do have a vacation planned the end of July (22nd-29th but not fully confirmed). .  We also don‚Äôt have a lot of family local and try to often travel to visit family in NY, PA and NC.   My husband has a very dynamic work schedule.  He can work at home a lot one week, be on travel the next and then work late at the office the following. So the bulk of dog and child responsibilities fall on me with Scott helping as much as he can when he is available.  I am a stay at home mom currently and plan to continue as such for a few more years.     As for weekends vs weekdays.  We are a bit more flexible on weekends.  We usually spend the time in family activities.  During soccer season we're going a lot on Sunday's for games but other than that we don't have regular commitments.    We are a fairly social family and there are often a few of the girls‚Äô friends and neighbors over in the house and yard.  On nice days we‚Äôll be outside for several hours after school until dinner.  There are a ton of children in our neighborhood and it is common to find a large group playing in the street outside our house.  Not all of these children are comfortable with dogs, but whenever possible our family dog is out with us and the kids.  We would really work best with a calmer pup who isn‚Äôt going to scare all the little ones that are over and near our house.  As for our family and personalities, we‚Äôll start with the resident dog.  My girls are pretty loud and active, but our family dog doesn't react to the screaming and running around that often occurs.  Maisey is a sweet affectionate pup who just loves to be around her people.  She is two years old and plays well with male and female dogs.  She‚Äôs submissive to most dogs and rarely corrects them.  She rarely barks, only at deer or animals in the woods behind us.  She‚Äôs a nervous girl in new situations and has come such a long way with separation anxiety.  She seems to thrive with another dog around (we had a foster for several weeks), it helps her confidence tremendously.  She is only crated at night.  We‚Äôre working hard on her leash manners and helping her get over her extreme fear of cars/trucks.  She has two speeds, couch potato or crazy energetic .  She LOVES to run around the yard with a playmate.  She seems to know very well when play gets too rough.  We are working to get her into agility (in basic clicker training at the moment), she is too adept at hopping the fence and but can climb the ladder into the girls‚Äô playhouse and runs back and forth across logs when we take her hiking as if it were nothing.    As for the people in the family, we all love dogs.  My children are animal lovers through and through.  They love dogs and I often find one or both of them snuggled up in a ball with our dog.  They will do best with a dog that is comfortable with noise and physical affection.  The girls do seem to understand how much is too much and I watch them closely and let them know when to back off and give some space.  They are very active and loud in their play, as are their friends.  For some reason they all walk very heavily for such little people!   My husband has a loud voice and walk too, so a dog easily startled may struggle a bit here.    Our neighborhood has a lot of dogs.  We also have dogs on either side of us.  One is VERY high strung and nervous. She is easily alarmed and barks often and frantically. Our dog doesn't get riled up by that at all and never barks in return. She barely acknowledges it actually.   I think that a high arousal dog may really struggle with this dog next door .  I also think my family might struggle with a dog that is a barker and reacts to noises, for as loud as they are, they are also noise sensitive (especially my youngest)."

After work my schedule is completely dedicated to my 2 dogs which I take with me whenever possible.    I get up at 6 am and get ready in 1 hour.  Then I take dogs out for a walk or to backyard depending on the weather.  They have access to water and doggy door to the backyard (small restricted area), plus full range of the house.  I leave at 7:30 a.m. and return at 5:30 at which time they come out for about 10 minutes.  Then I get them ready and we go for a 30 minute walk (my dogs are min pinschers, one is 6 lbs and the other 8 lbs, both females).  Then back home for them to eat and I might cook or relax for a bit.  We usually play for about 45 minutes from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. and the last time they go out to get busy is at 10 p.m.  Then lights out and they sleep through the night (on my bed).  If I have somewhere to go, after they eat we get ready and they come with me.  They are easy to carry so if allowed inside, both know how to behave and come in with me.  If not, then they know how to wait in the car (short periods of time and depending on the temperature).  Weekends I'm with my husband and if we are not going anywhere I can dedicate my time to a pup.  Hope this helps :)"

I work at American Express in the financial district, leaving the apartment around 8 am and returning by about 6 pm. I cannot come home during the day, but as Hannah is a tutor she has a much more flexible schedule. I also have the opportunity to work from home at least once a month, so I could always be around on days she could not. On the weekends I typically stay in New York City and hang out with my friends, but occasionally I go to New Jersey to see my family. I also try to go to the gym every day, either before, during, or after work depending on my schedule. Currently I also see friends during the week from time to time, but when and where is flexible, as is the gym. My schedule is more or less flexible except I work about 25 minutes from my apartment and will not have time to go home during the time I am at work, but  I can try to work from home more often. I would also certainly be able to take the dog to my parents in New Jersey if I did that for a weekend.  I have no long trips planned except for a ski trip the weekend after we receive the puppy, but Hannah has already told you and she will be there. If you need any other information please let me know!"

1068, ,0,0,,,,,02/09/12,"My wife and I have just moved to NY from Sydney, with an assured stay for work for another 18 months (and possible extension). Being newcomers to the city, we like to take every chance to get out and see as much as we can - everything here is as new to us as to a puppy too!   I work at Rockefeller University, and have long but flexible hours. I live literally across the road from where I work, so can be home in five minutes. I also come home for lunch regularly to enjoy lunch with my wife, who currently works 2 days a week as a babysitter. I would be able to come home every 3 to 4 hours for 20 minutes to take a puppy out for get busy breaks, although the exact timing would have to vary from day to day. Another researcher on my floor brings his dog into the lab sometimes, so that may also be a possibility for some days (but would depend on my supervisor).  Both work and home are high up in tall buildings. Our building is well populated with many other dogs, and the occasional cat. There are no dog-allowed play areas in our building, but a small outdoor area at work will provide opportunity for long-leash play (though not for GB).   Weekends are quite varied, with going to church and the gym being weekly occurances, but beyond that, anything can happen! We don't own a car, so public transport is how we get around (or walking, which we tend to do a lot). We don't go out of town for weekends, or travel for work. So except for the odd holiday, we are likely to be home continuously for the next 18 months.    We are both looking forward to the chance to raise a puppy with Guiding Eyes (as are our friends)!"
1069, ,0,0,,,,,02/09/12,"My week has flexible and stable parts to it. I will start with the stable: Tuesday and Thursday I leave the house before 8am and arrive home after 6pm for my babysitting job. Some of this time is spent with me taking Owen (the 3 year old I care for) around Manhattan and I am thinking it would be nice to drop by home sometimes to take my turn for middle of the day GB times and also introduce Owen to taking care of a dog, and the dog to being around children when there is just one.   Sunday mornings we go to church about a 45 minute walk (30mins on the bus) away from our apartment. Our church is about 100people strong, with 20ish kids, and we hope that when the pup is ready he will be able to come with us (but that will take some working up to with coffee hour after church consisting of many very excited children and a lot of adults chatting).  The flexible parts can include going to the gym, taking on other babysitting gigs (usually shorter ones, around 3 hours, sometimes in my apartment), having friends over, going downtown for coffee, doing the grocery shopping, cooking and other errands, and in the future volunteering at the library and at my church with womens' ministry. We tend to spend most nights at home, with the exception of friday night home group bible study up near our church.     The apartment we live in is a decent sized one bedroom apartment, managed by Rockefeller university who employs my husband. They are happy for dogs to live in the apartment (so long as they are registered with the building and cleaned up after in common areas) and there are two on our level that we may organise puppy play dates with :)  One thing that the housing department is very very picky about is the care we give their wood floors. We were warned at length about the need to keep the floors from getting wet as this has caused significant damage to apartments (and therefore the tennant's security bond). We have already purchased a rubber based matt for putting under the crate and food bowl, and are prepared with paper towel and remedies for cleaning ""accidents"" if the dog is ill or still being potty trained, but one thing that worries me is the possibility of getting a dog who salivates when treated or happy or relaxed (I have had a golden retriever in the past and thinking back I am glad he lived outside for this reason) because I don't want to spend my whole time with the pup anxiously watching for pools to clean up.      We are from Australia and so we travel, but not frequently. More often we have people from home staying on our couch. However at some point in the next year we plan to go back home for 2ish weeks, and also to do a few much shorter trips to interesting areas around the states, maybe even Europe. That is limited by our financial ability and so we would be lucky to have 2-3 extended weekends in the upcoming year.     In August I will consider whether to keep babysitting (and hence having a very flexible lifestyle) or seek a full time position in Ministry or Human Resource Management (my two areas of tertiary training).     We are people who value our sleep, so we tend to plan for 8 hours rest a night (though this will all change when we decide to have kids I am sure! Maybe the puppy will just be our practice round for this :p)    Everyone in our life is excited to meet the puppy, while we don't know many people here the friends we have made so far are great and we are already thinking as we read the training material which friends could help us teaching certain skills (e.g. greeting strangers). Many of these friends have (slash are) young children who will be very enthusiastic (one way or the other) about the dog, but will not be able to contain themselves with things like chasing inside."
1071, ,0,0,,,,,02/08/12,"My typical day begins around 6:45 when I get ready for work by eating, grooming, reading news, and preparing lunch. I try to be out the door by 8. It is possible for me to come home briefly at 12:30 if necessary, but I would like to avoid this. Paying for a dog sitter to come by if Kathlyn is unavailable is no problem. I usually come back home by 6pm, unless I need to go to the grocery store. I typically cook something and/or eat leftovers right when I get home. I typically cook 2 to 3 times a week. I rarely eat out, especially during the week. I usually am in bed by 11. My working hours are flexible, though I try to maintain a schedule. On the weekends I typically do some shopping or go for a walk. I occasionally make trips to NYC to visit museums or walk around, typically for about 6 hours, though my entire weekend is very flexible. I don't have a great deal of vacation time at work (only 2 weeks total), so I don't have the opportunity for much long-duration travel, except in the infrequent case of a work-related trip (usually just a couple of days, and maybe once or twice a year).     I live on the 6th floor of an 8 story apartment building with a large number of dogs and small children. There is a park with a children's playground directly across the street. We are about 3 blocks from downtown White Plains. There are several small parks within walking distance, both highrises and areas with small houses, and a highway about 7 blocks away. Metro-North is 7 blocks away. I have a car."
1073, ,0,0,,,,,02/07/12,"I live in a small building (8 apartments) in East Harlem and am friends with most of my neighbors. It's a 4th floor walk-up, so the stairs might be a challenge for a very small pup, but I am willing to carry him or her up and down in the beginning if they need it. There are two other dogs in the building, but they are friendly and well behaved. Both are fixed. We have a completely fenced in backyard where all the neighbors get together and hang out in the summer, and I can take the pup to play. We're also pretty close to the top of central park, and I am looking forward to walking there with the pup in the mornings. My apartment is fairly large for Manhattan, so there is lots of room to run around and play. My boyfriend lives in Stamford, CT and we are usually only together on weekends. I imagine that we will be in NYC every weekend until the pup and I get used to each other, but after that might go and visit his place in CT. We will always be back in time for class on Sunday though! I don't have a typical weekend schedule, but usually spend a lot of time at home catching up on errands and chores. If Andrew (the boyfriend) is in town, we will go to a show or out to dinner in the evenings.     I work at an off-Broadway theatre company with offices in the Flatiron district. I generally work Monday through Friday, 10a - 6p, but sometimes have after work commitments. I probably won't be able to get home in the middle of the day, so the pup will likely come with me to work everyday. Everyone in the office is supportive and ok with having him or her around in theory, and I will do everything I can to make it work in practice. I am worried it will be a semi-tough transition, but I think it will ultimately work out. The pup and I will have to take the subway to work everyday, as it is too far to walk. I plan on having a crate at the office in addition to the one at home.     I will likely change jobs in the next few months and don't know what that situation will end up being. It might not be a place where I can take the pup everyday, and I might not be able to get home in the afternoon. I don't know. Since I am raising the pup alone, that might mean I should wait until the next round of classes later this year -- but if there is a way to work it out now, I would really love to. I am really looking forward to raising a pup and believe very strongly in the work of GEB. I think that no matter what my job situation changes to be, I will be able to figure something out -- I just may need some extra support from another raiser or sitter in the middle of the day. Mornings and evenings should be fine. I don't know if that is an option, but I am 100% committed to raising a puppy!  I really hope to be able to volunteer in this way."

During the summers I live at my parents house where there is a large, partially fenced in backyard with plenty of room for a puppy to play. My parents have a cat but no other pets. This coming summer I have an internship with the Cornell Sheep Farm and will be there most of the time during the week. I am unsure how they would feel about me bringing a puppy and so I may postpone starting the program until later in the summer if that is an issue. I will likely also work at Pampered Pets at the Ithaca Mall on the weekends where I am sure the puppy would be welcome to hang out behind the counter. I may also occasionally do some work at a dairy farm where I am sure the puppy would be welcome. While I am in school, I will be living in a one bedroom apartment with one other person and my pet turtle (who does like to walk around the apartment occasionally). The apartment is on the second floor and I will have neighbors but the facility seems very pet-friendly. Since I am a student, my schedule during the week will depend on my class schedule. I may also be working in labs a few hours a week. One or two days a week I volunteer at a horse sanctuary where there are not only horses (and a pony) but plenty of cats and dogs running around. I also help out at an alpaca farm in the morning on weekends. Also, when I can, I shadow and volunteer at veterinary clinics. In the winter, I ski and snowboard. I work at a ski resort and am on my school ski team so I will likely leave the puppy with a friend who has gone through the training during these activities but I will try to include the puppy whenever possible. Needless to say I don't have the most routine life but the puppy would certainly be exposed to a plethora of environments and situations."

We are hoping to be puppy sitters, not full time raisers (mainly because we're both not sure where we will be when our lease is up this October).  We live in an apartment that is on the smaller side - it is two bedrooms, and has a living room/kitchen area and long hallway.  Danielle works full time (9-5), while I am a private tutor.  This means that my schedule is pretty flexible. I work in Greenwich, CT on Mondays, Tuesdays, and sometimes Wednesdays.  While in Greenwich, I usually stay at my parents' house there.  I take the Metro-North train there (about a 45 minute train ride), and on these days would hopefully bring the puppy along with me (as it will be easier for me to be home often etc than for Danielle).  My parents are excited about the idea of me bringing the puppy here, but I will be solely responsible for its care.  I can get an extra crate etc. to keep in Greenwich.  Danielle is also able to work from home occasionally (as she will expand upon in her quiz), so between us we should always be able to work something out (and, as sitters, would just not sign up to sit when there was a conflict!).  Greenwich will have great and varied socialization opportunities from those found in the city (beach, woodsy trails, riding in a car, etc)!  As a tutor, I am usually out tutoring around the city (or around town in Greenwich) for 3 to 4 hours at a time, in the afternoons.  Sometimes I have meetings in the morning for some research projects I'm working on, but basically I am flexible to come home at intervals according to the puppy's age and needs.  And I generally have a couple hours of free time every day to spend with the puppy, in addition to integrating the puppy into my routine!  On weekday evenings, Danielle and I will either cook at home, or go out for dinner with friends (again, we are very happy to adjust our schedule based on puppy's needs).  On weekends, my schedule is pretty much the same, because I often tutor on weekends.    We run outdoors when weather permits, so when babysitting puppies that were old enough and ready with their leash skills, we could take them for short runs.  We have a couple of friends with well-behaved and healthy dogs, which could potentially be fun socialization opportunities (not sure of the GEB guidelines on this but we would of course follow them).    We don't know any vets in our area or have any friends who live in the area with pets who could recommend one - does GEB have any vets they recommend near the Lower East Side?  I have experience with positive reinforcement training (with dogs and dolphins), and I am really excited and curious to learn about the specifics of the GEB program and methods!

My schedule will change slightly for next year but will be approximately the same amount of hours per day, if not less. I generally have classes in the mornings and am free in the afternoons and evenings. This year, I was also on BC's Dance Team, but I will not be continuing with that next year, so I will have more free time to devote to raising our puppy. On the weekends, I tend to hangout with my friends and occasionally go into Boston. The majority of the weekend I would be able to take the puppy with me to experience a wide variety of situations and people. On Sundays I generally do my homework for the week, but this is usually done at home. If I chose to go to the library Saxon and I could take turns with staying with the puppy. We will be living in an apartment in Chestnut Hill next semester on the second floor. There are around 12 apartments in the building we will be living in so a quieter puppy would be helpful. For school breaks the puppy will be traveling with me back to my house in MA. At home it will be my parents and myself, along with our three large dogs. We have a large fenced in yard and live in a small town approximately 1 hour outside of Boston."

Weekday flexibility varies with vacation and/or work schedule.  Also, my husband comes home daily on lunch and works only 5 minutes from work.  His hours are shorter.  Prefer a puppy that does not play bite and or does not have a tendency to bark a lot.  Prefer a calm puppy as it works much better when bringing a puppy into work."

At ~6.45 it's dinner time, we do generally 10mn of training before the dinner (I use the fact he is hungry to teach him some tricks ;-). We go for one or two more walks and then it's bed time at 9-9.30pm.  During the week end, we generally go for a hike somewhere, we sometime visit a friend of mine who has also a dog. Then there is the usual house cleaning + lots of cuddles and attention to my dog :-)  Things you should know:   *I live in an apartment on the bottom floor, from the windows you can see the dog park. This is probably a good exercise for the guide dogs since they will have to behaved while looking at dogs running around outside.  *My dog is very active and likes to play. He is good with most dogs, he is neutered. Since I don't know much about his history, I have been working with some trainers to socialize him with other dogs but I got him only 2-3 months ago so I am still discovering his personality.   * I will be gone for 2 weeks in February and probably another week in July."

Over the summer I work at a restaurant, though the hours can be tailored to my schedule and I get breaks every four hours.

We also have an in-ground pool in our backyard that is fenced in with a deck and our garden.   Since I am doing this as my senior project this year, my time throughout the year really is going to be dedicated to the puppy, to the best of my ability. My parents will be by my side to help me in care and training, but I will be the primary raiser. I have also just found out my parents are going to be getting a divorce, which will be a big shock to me, though since no papers have been filed that is still at least six months out. However, they are both aware that this puppy is going to have to come first, and if one were to move out it would have to be to a place that accepts dogs. It is my hope to not introduce any stress to the puppy as this process unfolds, but instead maybe living in two different places could be useful for training.   This coming April I will be on vacation in Florida for 10 days, which may mean a puppy sitter will be necessary.  I am a pretty athletic person, with my basketball almost year round, though at home I don't necessarily exercise often.

1239, ,0,0,,,,,06/14/11,"Our family has three children under the age of (soon to be) 10, two parents, two fish and a cat.  The cat is very good with dogs and teaches them who is boss immediately.  :)  We homeschool so we are home for a large portion of the day.  We do go to classes at a local Adventist school for music (M,W) and PE (T, Th).  These classes (last year) kept us from the house for a minimum of 1 hour to a max of 2 1/2 hours at a time.  This school is 12 minutes away from our house and it is possible that since it is a private school the pup may be allowed to go with us at times. Another time we would be away from the pup would be for church on Saturday.  That could be anywhere from 3-4 hours.  However, once again the pup may be allowed to come with us OR we can go home and check on the pup as well so it's time ""alone time"" wouldn't be past it's ""age allowance"".  This is at the same location as the school.  We also take my FIL out shopping or to Dr. appts.  Once again the pup might be able to come with us or we would make sure that the pup is only in the crate for the allotted amount of time.  My husband does a lot of traveling, but when he is home he also could come and take care of the pup if we are away from home past the allotted time allowed in the crate.  His work is 20 minutes from our house.  We do try to go on trips with my husband (for work) once ina  while.  This shouldn't be a problem though with ""puppy sitting"".  We can plan accordingly.  We have a fenced in back yard (pool is in a separate area fenced off from the kids/house) and a nice neighborhood with sidewalks and plenty of nice neighbors and various dogs to get to know.  The only other thing I can think of is going to NY to visit my parents.  Once again any dog could come with us, but since we are going to be ""puppy sitters"" this should not come into play.  We have not used the animal hospital listed as of yet.  We are planning on taking our cat the end of June/beginning of July and this vet was highly reccomended from our neighbor."

We live in a two story house in the woods on the Potomac River, approximately a quater of a mile off the main road. We have an open yard as well as a fenced in side yard. We have no visible neighbors. A lot of our neighbors walk and we live in a very 'walkable' neighborhood will little traffic. There are no sidewalks in the immediate neighborhood, but there are sidewalks within two blocks. When the puppy is prepared and mature, we can introduce him/her to many new circumstances. Our family does not own any pets or animals. During the summer, unless our family is on a long distance vacation, there is usually at least one person home. This summer, I do not have long term vacation plans, and will remain here. A typical day during the summer is very flexible. I wake up around 8, eat breakfast, go for a run and do chores. When school resumes a typical day would be as follows. My father drives my brother and I to school on his way to work. We wake up at 6 and leave the house at 7. Prior to leaving to school, I would be able to play with, train, take the puppy to GB and feed/him or her. My mom, Kim, usually works at home the majority of the day and would be able to watch the puppy while I am at school. I am actively involved with the school, participating in school sports and musicals. I have soccer practice and rehearsal almost everyday after school until my mom comes to pick me up. Once home, our family does homework, works and eats a family dinner together. My brother and I then go to bed. Weekends are generally free, with the occasional soccer game. Our whole family is excited and open to welcoming a puppy into our family and will be able to adapt our schedule to meet the puppy's needs and expose him/her to various situations and environments once ready and mature."

We live on the fifth floor of a our apartment building and have plenty of open space for playing and training. We plan on getting a gate to block of the kitchen and other smaller areas of the house to help create safe zones for the puppy (though we will utilize the crating procedure). We are both very active and very social people but are committed to being good puppy sitters and will adjust our schedule/outings accordingly for the puppy's needs. I do travel for work on a monthly basis but am usually only gone one or two days. Martyn rarely travels and will be able to care for the pup in my absence.

1295, ,0,0,,,,,05/05/11,"Lets see...I'll give you as much info as I can and it may not be in complete order...My day currently begins with getting my two girls up and ready for school, the first at 6 and the second at 7:30.  They are out of the house by 8:20.  My son goes to afternoon kindergarten at 12:10.  Typically, after the girls get on their way, I do housework, errands if needed and play with my son Colby.  I do not currently work outside the home and therefore my days are fairly flexible. During the school year I attend a bilbe study class on Thursday mornings from 9-11:30 here in Avon.  We live on  a private lot surrounded by woods.  There is not any fencing.  We have deer, turkey, and a variety of other wildlife that comes through our property.  We also have three indoor cats.  We do a lot of outdoor play- baseball, soccer, tag, using the play set and rope swing.  We take walks on a regular basis.  During the school year the kids are busy with dance, basketball, soccer, and baseball dependent upon the season. I go to a variety of grocery stores and love taking different roads to and from places to give myself a change of scenery.  We go to the landfill to dispose of our garbage twice a week.  We have brooks on our property that flow under our driveway.  We enjoy going to the beach but don't get there very often. The kids are home from school beginning at 3 and everyone is in by 4:00.  We do the typical outside play, chauffer to afterschool activities, dinner prep, baths, and homework. I typically pick the kids up at school about 3-6 x a month.  In the summer we go to Maine for a week or two to a family cabin on  a lake.  We typically go on day trips in the summer and the public pool in the afternoon on hot days.  We kayak on occassion and visit with family and friends.  We do attend church (mostly on a regular basis). I exercise on a regular basis and go running a couple times a week in the nicer weather.  We like energy but we also like downtime.  Our house is one level but we are up and down the basement stairs a number of times a day because we have a food pantry in the basement.  The basement area is almost completely finished and will eventually become play space and tv area and exercise space.  The color palette of our house is light- if that matters at all.  No worries if it doesn't.  I vaccum most everyday.  Wow- I feel so boring.  I do volunteer at Gifts of Love on a weekly basis- I deliver packs to the Avon schools on Thur and/ or Fri during the school year.  We will have painters at our house in July to paint the exterior or the house and then we'll be re-doing our deck.  Not sure if that will be hired out or not yet.  I try to get everyone tucked into bed  by 8:30-9 at the latest and I try to turn in between 10 and 11 pm.  My two youngest kids have a tendency to be loud with their voices and laughter.    I certainly try to foster independence and responsibility with my children and have been told that I am patient and consistent  with them."

My husband is also retired and he is home most of the time. We spend a lot of time working in the yard. We take daily walks with our dog. My house is situated on a two acre lot and the back yard consists of a one-acre fenced-in field. Our mud room leads to a secure fenced-in concrete dog run which allows a dog to be inside or outside at will. I have a 4 year old male (neutered) golden retriever who gets along well with other dogs and cats. I have two male (neutered) cats -- brothers -- who are 3 years old. For the past 20 years my husband and I have rescued greyhounds. Our last greyhound died in January -- she was almost 15 years old. Throughout my lifetime I have had other breeds of dogs including a giant schnauzer and a standard poodle. We raised our golden retriever as a pup so that makes me confident that we can take on a new pup at this time. My oldest son lives in Las Vegas so we try to get out to see his family (our two grandchildren) at least once a year. We also spend a week at our timeshare in the wintertime. Other than that, our travels usually involve automobile travel and we take our dog with us."

We also have nice yard that I can keep the puppy in but no fence so I will keep the puppy on a leash at all times outside. We live in a raised ranch so there will be plenty of opportunity to work on stairs. I have a hamster that loves to run in his hamster ball and which I keep in my room.

I do plan on working but only in 4 hour shifts and even then there will be at least one person home with the puppy. Both of my parents and my sister are excited about the idea of having a puppy and they are eager to learn the rules on how to raise him properly. I usually wake up between 8-9 am and go to sleep around 11 (during the summer). I am not looking at any major changes from that schedule. The details play a bigger role once I get back to school. I will be living in a house off campus. I plan on taking 4 classes during the week instead of 5 which will give me more time for the puppy. I wake up around 9 and will be available to feed and exercise the puppy throughout the day except for when I am at class.I try to exercise myself around 10 and eat lunch around 12. After that I will have more time for the puppy while fitting classes in and then I eat dinner when my schedule allows for it usually between 5-7 pm. I try to get my work done throughout the day in short bursts and like to have it completely done by the time I eat dinner so my night time is free. I go to bed around 12 and do it all again the next day. I dont know my exact schedule so its hard to be specific but that is the general idea.

I realize I will have to let the girls and the puppy meet slowly and be comfortable with each other so I plan to leave the girls in the car while I take the pup out to get busy then bring him in and feed him. I will then bring the girls in so they can get to know him and play with him while waiting for his time to get busy again before we leave. I""ll put the girls back in the car and take the puppy outside again then bring him back into his crate.  leaving the girls in the car will probably only happen in the beginning until everyone is comfortable with each other.

I also have all four children interact with my own family I have a married 25 yr old daughter and a 22 year old son in college. this will also extend to the new puppy. after he has had his rabies shots and is able to be around other dogs I can bring him to my house which has a fenced in yard and a swimming pool.

A folding crate would make the next few months easier, in that regard.  We also do not have a car, though I will begin to look into purchasing one.  Location/Support: We live in Brooklyn and want to connect to other people in the community who are also in this Borough.  I will be taking care of the dog on my own, the only adult.  My daughter is taking classes, but can only train the dog under my supervision.  I would appreciate support, in the case I can't get home when needed, or we need to be away for a day.  We have only one planned holiday in April for 10 days.  Ideally, the dog would go to another trained person in in the community, to keep up the good habits.  I understand that I am allowed to kennel the dog.  I would prefer to keep the training going, to not have to begin again upon return.  Schedule: I work freelance, so there is flexibility in my schedule.  It would be helpful to have people I could call on to walk the dog, mid-day, though.  Not every day, but at least twice a week.  I am a landlord and a playwright/theatre artist.  I can often work from home.  Mornings, I get my daughter up and off to school.  Afternoons, I pick her up.  Weekends, my daughter and I can be with the puppy.    Personality: We travel by subway and bus.  I understand that in the first months, the puppy should be gently introduced to such loud environments.  It would be helpful to have a puppy who has already been exposed to the subways.  Even though I intend to get a car, even when I do have a car, we will continue to use the subway, often.    Experience with GED: The business administrator of my daughter's school has a guide dog from your organization.  He's spoken about how the dog has changed his life.  We've been waiting for this opportunity for quite some time.  Our first experience with a guide dog was with a dog in training, to work with a child with autism.  I had looked into classes for my daughter, as I understood they utilized 'normal' children to train the dogs before they were sent to families.  This was in Oregon.  Out in New York, we found Guiding Eyes, searching for such a situation.  We will obviously need a lot of support, but we're very excited to potentially help train a dog that can have a rich life in service."

I am hoping to really involve the kids in all aspects of training the puppy and also hoping they will learn the value of service. Helping raise a dog that will go on to help someone else. We are really looking forward to it. We had a labrador in our lives for 14 years and he passed away last year. We raised him from the age of 8 weeks and he was very well trained and the most amazing dog I've ever had. It's been awhile but we are familiar with crating and training a puppy but are eager to learn GEB's methods. I am a photographer and have somewhat unpredictable hours but spend approximately 40% of my time working at home. My wife (Debbie) is a jewelry designer and works in a studio near our house and will be able to have the puppy with her when I am out. Our previous dog was with us all the time because of our work situation. Our lives like most parents are pretty hectic. We get up Mon-Fri at 7am, prepare breakfast, shower and get the kids ready for school. Debbie leaves the house with the kids around 7:50 am & then goes to her studio. I stay home and work but I am usually out and about at least 2 days a week. I pick the kids up from school at 3 pm & take them to the park from 3-4 pm then we return home to do homework, hang out together (if the homework is done!) and make dinner. Kids are in bed by 9 pm and Debbie and I go to bed at 11 pm. Weekend activities vary. Usually soccer games (in winter & summer) kid's birthday parties etc. We may travel sometimes during spring break and mid-winter recess (February) and sometimes to Debbie's parent's in OK for Christmas. In the summer we go to my parent's house in Long Island every weekend and swim and do lots of beach type activities. We also go on 2-3 week camping trips every summer and the kids may go to summer camp for the first month or 2. We live in a 4 story brownstone in Brooklyn and share the house with my brother, his wife and their 2 boys. So our house is filled with energetic kids a lot of the time. We also have a cat who is around 8 years old and very mellow. He was well-mannered with our previous dog and we're not worried about his behavior. I guess the main issue with the dog will be all the kid centered activities that he will need to fit in with. But hopefully it will be a learning experience for all!"

When not working, I take the kids to school then come home and do housework, run errands, etc.  Weekend schedule includes taking the kids to/from sports activities, along with my husband.  Most of my schedule is flexible and decided by me.      We live in a townhouse with one immediate next door neighbor.

Exposure between 7 AM and 1 PM  Get busy around  2 or 3 PM    Exposure between 2 PM and 11 PM    Dinner around 5 PM    Get busy around 8 or 9 PM         She needs at least 2 exposures of 30 minutes each. She usually gets 3 exposures totaling 2 hour.    Camille usually does not run around in the backyard very much. She will often lay in the sun on cooler days and in the shade on hot days.     If she is around other dogs you have in your home, she will play very nicely with them, but most of her exercise comes from walking.    She usually only gets busy before an exposure. You may need to walk her up and down the driveway to get her busy in the afternoon and evening.    When I kennel Camille I give her 4 kibbles after she goes into the crate. she does not eat anything off the ground, so I never use kibble from heaven any longer. She does like to have a bone in the crate with her. She likes her crate and never whines when I leave and is quite when I return.         I never let her have toys she can rip and eat because she will eat them. She will even eat her Kong, so I never leave that in the crate with her. She never chews on anything around the house, but if you let her have a toy she can pick apart, she will and it will end up going through her system. She also plays with a tennis ball supervised. But she ignores all other balls I have on the ground.    She sleeps at the foot of the bed, but is fine if you want her in the crate at night.  On walks she can go 60 minutes with no distractions and therefore no reason to reward her for reconnecting with me. So I reward her for walking at a nice pace with me and checking in with me every so often. I ask her to sit or down as we are walking, then I reward her as Jeanne discussed."

Joanie experiences the commute in her crate each day and office manners at work.  We get up at 6am, she goes out first to get busy and then we come in for her breakfast. Joanie settles while i get ready in bathroom and then we make my breakfast. She gets treats (apples) intermittently for skills while i make breakfast. Joanie loads up in kennel in car and we commute to rochester, i eat breakfast on the way. now that it is dark in the mornings we do our 1/2hr loose leash walk in rochester in the village where i work, used to be at home before leaving for work when it was light out. while at work, i intermittently treat her for skills. she is gated in my office, it is only me in the room.  so she is free to walk around room but prefers her go place rug or under my desk at my feet. i try to get her out for 15min/half hour walk at lunch if it allows, otherwise we do training in the office or we go to exposure place such as town offices or library, sometimes a little of each.  she goes out to get busy 3x during the day and she loads up again for commute home. She eats at 6pm and then we do a half hour walk or she gets to play with Sammy (my parents dog) or we do an outing--try to change it up everyday or sometimes get to do all 3, was much easier when daylight was longer.. i have 2 cats, i gate areas in my house to give them a peaceful place to rest while Joanie still learns to respect them. Weekends are much the same, we do our same wakeup/feed time but go back to sleep and Joanie is very good about sleeping in a little more.  We fit half hour walks in twice a day, play at playdate or with Sam,and an outing hopefully.  Joanie loves the car and rarely is kenneled home alone, she comes to my parents house, brothers, friends, family..we stop along the way when i see an opportunity for her as much as possible for outing. i used to go to gym but haven't since march and do not miss it! love getting out with Joanie and the fresh air, i no longer even have a membership and don't ever want one again.

I am 16 years old, and I have three brothers. My oldest brother (Bruno) is 20 and works in Georgia, but he comes to visit regularly. My two other brothers are Pierre (14 years old) and Rapha√´l (11 years old). They go to St Matthew's Catholic school in Virginia Beach, and my mom drives takes/pick them there. I am a Junior (11th Grade) at Bishop Sullivan Catholic High School in Virginia Beach and I take the bus at Orchard Square.    Here is my schedule:    Every morning, my mom and I wake up at 5am. I will be taking care of the puppy from 5am to 6am (feeding, getting busy, playing outside, working to learn whatever we are supposed to teach it that week). At 6am, my mom wakes up my two younger brothers. She will take care of the puppy, while we all get ready for school.    We leave the house at 7:50am. We will take the puppy with us to the bus stop. Then, my mom takes my brothers to school. At 7:50am, she will drop off the puppy back at home in its crate while she goes to work until 11am. Then, she comes home from 11am to 1pm and will care for the puppy then. She goes back to work until 4pm. She works 3.17 miles from home, so she is close enough to go back and forth when needed. At 4:00pm, she'll go to pick up the puppy, and take it with her to get my brothers at their school, then, me at the bus stop. The bus usually drops me at around 4pm in front of the Farm Fresh, but I wait inside the store in the Starbuck section, and do my homework there until my mom comes (by 4:50pm usually). Most of the times, I have finished my homework by the time she picks me up. Then, we go home, and mom cooks dinner. I will take the puppy outside, feed it, etc... from 5:00pm to 6:00pm, which is when dinner is usually ready. Pierre also finishes his homework during the after-school CARE (from 3pm to 4:30pm) while waiting for my mom. Rapha√´l, because of his disease, has a little brain damage, so he is never finished with homework during the after-school CARE, but he finishes it while mom cooks dinner. Pierre and I can take turns caring for the puppy until dinner.    On Monday evening: We go to our weekly Puppy Raiser meeting from 7pm to 9pm. So, we leave home at 6:30pm. The puppy will come with us to these meetings. Then, when we get home, I'll take my shower first, so that I can walk the puppy while my brothers take theirs. Rapha√´l goes to bed at 8pm, Pierre at 8:30pm, I go at around 9pm, and mom goes soon after us, unless she has work to do. (She is currently translating a book for a French author, so sometimes, she works on it while everyone sleeps). Puppy will go to bed at 9pm, when I take it to its crate for the night.    On Tuesday evenings, we don't do anything, so we can be home with the puppy. During Baseball seasons, Pierre and Rapha√´l usually have games or practices on that night. but I stay home, and can care for the puppy.     On Wednesday evenings: Rapha√´l and I go fencing at Virginia Wesleyan College from 7:30pm to 9:00pm. Mom takes us there and stays there at the Food Court while we practice. She will be taking the puppy with us, so that she can walk and work with it outside in the parking lot while we practice fencing.    On Thursday evenings: Mom has a photography club meeting from 7pm to 9pm, that she goes to on the 1st and 3rd Thursday of each month. On weeks that she doesn't have the meeting, she stays with us at home.    On Fridays, I do fencing with my school's club at Bishop Sullivan, so mom comes with my brothers to pick me up there. On Fridays, mom works until noon only, and she is 'free' in the afternoons. So, she'll be home caring for the puppy, and taking it with her to get my brothers, then, they'll come to pick me up after fencing. Usually, she stays in the parking lot and watches us practice outside. The puppy will be able to watch us too.    On Saturday mornings, mom teaches a French Class at ODU in Norfolk, but she gets home by 1pm. I will be home to care for the puppy while she teaches. On the 1st and the 3rd Saturday of the month, Pierre, Rapha√´l and I have Altar Boys practice at church from 10am to noon. So, on these days, puppy will go to ODU in the classroom with mom. Puppy will do whatever we are doing on Saturday afternoons. Mom usually tries, once a month to take us somewhere (like in Greenville, SC, to go to walk in the mountains...).    On Sundays, we go to mass (church) from 10:30am to noon. The puppy will stay home. Church is also less than 3 miles from home, so, mom asked Father if we could bring the puppy to church once it is old enough to behave. Father is all right with it. So, the first few months, puppy will stay home while we go to church, but once it starts behaving well enough, we'll start taking it to church with us.    Sunday afternoon, Rapha√´l and I go to a Pokemon Cards club. For the first few months, puppy will stay with mom at home (or wherever she goes when she takes her long walks outside), then, later on, I plan on taking the puppy with me there (when he can stay a couple of hours in one spot, behaving). On Sunday afternoons, Pierre is always outside playing football with his friends, so mom may take it to watch the boys play."

I am usually up until around midnight doing my schoolwork.  If I am not scheduled to work, the dogs stay out with me.  Usually I am off Friday-Monday.  Because I do have multiple dogs in the household, it might be better to have a female puppy.  This would limit a male puppy from scent marking.  Although all of the dogs are spayed or neutered and house trained, this would make sure that the puppy is a success.  I stay in a private house with a huge backyard so I have no issue with space. Our weekends are fun filled, we try to spend as much time out as possible.  The children in the home are aged 11 and 16 and have been around dogs since they were 4 yrs old.

I'm out in the car a lot, so the puppy comes with me and my 10-year old golden retriever traveling on the floor of the passenger seat in the front of my car.  We play a lot with the children in the neighborhood and spend lots of time socializing/training outside of class with other GEB raisers at their homes, etc.  The puppy is always well exercised, socialized with people and other GEB dogs (and my own cat and dog) and is exposed to many different situations as it matures."

Work start times vary greatly, from starting at 7am  or 1pm or 6 pm. I work in the movie and tv industry. In the past, I would bring my dog, Tiger (released GEB dog) with me to work. If he stayed home, often my husband was with him. (he was a NYC firefighter and worked 24 hr shifts). I have a dog walker who would take Tiger out if I could not take him with me or my husband was working.   I work freelance, so often I have time off between jobs. For example, I just finished working on a tv show, so I have been off for a few weeks. When I am off, my days are pretty simple. House chores, catching up on projects and such.

In the afternoon I go to the gym for about an hour and make lunch after. In the evening I typically stay in and do my work. I will be able to walk and work with the puppy all throughout the day. I have a very open schedule right now, which is why I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to care for a pup."
1643, ,0,0,,,,,05/13/10,"A typical day currently involves waking up and having a cup of coffee and preparing for work (hours vary from day-to-day but are regular set hours...that is, all thursdays are like all other thursdays but different from fridays).  currently, my hours as an employee are m 3-7:30, t 12-3, th 10-5, fr 10-6, occasional fr 8-6.   in my self-employed capacity, the rest of my hours are self-determined.  when i am not working, i typically spend time with my husband either at home with our cats and birds or at the bookstore, library, or metroparks.  we have a fairly quiet lifestyle and rarely go out in the evenings or for all-day events.  currently, i am not sure how i could meet the puppy's housetraining needs (every 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on age) with my work schedule;  the housetraining needs are the primary reason that we are only considering raising an older puppy that has been started by another raiser.  as the pre-placement classes continue, i might learn of ways to meet a young puppy's housetraining needs.      regarding appropriate meal routines, veterinary visits, consistency, socializing, and other needs, i will meet these needs by following GEB's suggested guidelines and using the provided tools (matrices, exposure guidelines and so forth).  although i can incorporate most of the training into my daily life as suggested, i will also make choices and participate in activities that wouldn't normally be part of a typical day (e.g., public transit, attend a sporting event).  other needs, such as keeping the puppy safe and healthy, will be met by restricting access to unsafe or healthy items (poisonous house plants, litter box, etc.), always having the puppy in sight or crated or as otherwise directed by GEB, and following all veterinary requirements including regular visits and regular administration of flea medication and heartworm preventative.    i anticipate that the need for appropriate play and downtime will be one of the easiest to meet.  my family enjoys animals and we especially look forward to this aspect of our responsibilities."

1669, ,0,0,,,,,04/18/10,"I am currently not working outside of the home,  so my day centers around the house and our small town. My husband and I are early risers (5-6am) so I usually get up first to let the animals out (a dog and 2 cats) and make coffee. There is the usual morning rush around dragging a sixteen year old out of bed and getting her to school by 8am, then the routine of the house chores and errands about town. If I do leave the pup crated I imagine it will be for periods of less than 30 minutes at a time. I have a reliable puppy sitter for any emergency absences.     I pick up our daughter after school or sports practice, music lessons, etc. and play Taxi for much of the afternoon. I imagine this will be good training for the pup.  I do go for an exercise walk in the early morning or afternoons (usually an hour plus) but I don't think I will be able to do this with the puppy. It's usually about five or six miles. I'm not sure how I will adjust this portion of my day. I would like to keep exercising but that's just too long to leave a puppy.    The evening consists of dinner around 7pm and an early bedtime around 9:30pm or so. Kind of boring I guess! : )"
